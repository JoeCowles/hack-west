two so let's review some basic concepts that you'll need in a typical algebra course first you need to understand how to add subtract multiply and divide fractions so let's briefly review that concept let's say if we want to add three over four plus two over five how can we do so now whenever you're adding or subtracting fractions you need to have the same denominator which we don't have for the first fraction the denominator is four for the second one we have a five in the bottom so we need to adjust these two fractions in order to get a common denominator we need to multiply the first fraction by five over five whatever you do to the top you must do to the bottom so if you're going to multiply the top number by five you have to multiply the bottom number by five now the second fraction i want to multiply the top and the bottom number by four because five times four will give us 20 and that will lead to the same denominator so now we could add the two fractions 15 plus 8 is 23 so the answer is 23 over 20. now here's another example 5 over 6 minus 4 over 7. feel free to try this problem if you want to go ahead and pause the video now if you're not sure what to multiply by multiply by the other denominator so five over six you can multiply the top and bottom by seven and four of a seven multiply the top and the bottom by six this will give you a common denominator of forty two now seven times five is thirty five four times six is 24 and 7 times 6 is 42 and now we can subtract the two numbers on top so 35 minus 24 that's 11. so the answer is 11 divided by 42. now what about multiplying two fractions what's seven over five times four over three when multiplying two fractions you don't need to have the same denominator in the case of when you're adding or subtracting fractions all you need to do is just multiply across seven times four is twenty-eight so you got to multiply the two numbers on top and then after that multiply the two numbers on the bottom five times three is 15. so the answer is 28 divided by 15. so here's another example 3 over five times six over four three times six is eighteen five times four is twenty now sometimes you may need to reduce the fraction which is what we need to do in this example eighteen is nine times two twenty is ten times two so notice that we could cancel a two so the final answer is nine over ten so when multiplying two fractions you could simply multiply across now sometimes you may have to multiply two fractions that contain very large numbers for example 28 over 63 times 56 divided by 35. now you don't want to multiply 28 by 56 because it's going to give you a big number and then you have to simplify that big number which is a lot of extra work the best thing to do is to simplify the numbers now 28 is seven times four sixty-three is seven times nine fifty-six is eight times seven and thirty-five is five times seven so notice that we could cancel a seven on the left and on the right we can also cancel a 7. now there's nothing else that we can cancel so all we got to do is multiply 4 by 8 which is 32 and then 9 times 5 which is 45 and this is the answer notice that we didn't need a calculator for this example so the answer is 32 divided by 45. now what about dividing two fractions what's 36 over 52 divided by 27 over 65 whenever you want to divide two fractions you want to keep in mind this expression keep change flip so what it means is you need to keep the first fraction the same next change division to multiplication and then flip the second fraction so now this problem is like the last problem so instead of multiplying 36 by 65 let's break down 36 into more manageable numbers 36 is 9 times 4. 52 is 13 times 4 65 is 13 times 5 and 27 is 9 times 3 so we could cancel a 13 we can get rid of a 4 and we can get rid of a 9. so the final answer for this problem is 5 divided by 3. so that's just a basic review of fractions things you just have to know if you're going to take algebra trig precal calculus or any other higher level math class so make sure you know these principles now the next thing you need to understand is adding and subtracting like terms for example let's say if you want to simplify this expression five x plus three x squared minus seven x plus four x cubed plus eight x squared now you can't add 5x and 3x squared they're not like terms x and x squared are completely different you can however combine 5x and negative 7x because the five and negative seven they're attached to the same thing that is x so five plus negative seven that's a negative two so you can combine that into negative two x those are like terms we can't add 3x squared with 4x cubed they're not like terms x squared and x cube are different we can however combine 3x squared and 8x squared those are like terms so all you got to do is add 3 plus 8 and that will give you 11. and then the last one you can't combine with anything so that's just 4x cubed so make sure you know when you can combine certain terms and when you can now we mentioned that we cannot add 5 x plus 3x squared but can we multiply 5x times 3x squared so you can't add unlike terms but you can multiply them 5 times 3 is 15. x times x squared is x cubed when you're multiplying variables you need to add the exponents for example x to the fourth times x to the seventh that's going to be x to the four plus seven which is x to the eleventh when dividing you can subtract the exponents so x to the seventh divided by x to the fourth is the same as x to the seven minus four which is x cubed and when you raise one exponent to another let's say x cubed raised to the fourth power you need to multiply the exponents 3 times 4 is 12. so that's x to the 12th now here's something that can help you to understand why that works so let's say if you're multiplying x squared by x cubed i like to think of it this way x squared means that you're multiplying x times x two x variables x cubed means that you're multiplying x times x times x three x variables so in total you really multiply in five x variables and two plus three is five so that's why when you're multiplying variables of the same type you're allowed to add the exponents when you're dividing let's say x to the fifth divided by x cubed x to the fifth is basically five x variables multiplied to each other x cubed is three x variables so you can cancel three on top and three on the bottom which leaves 2 left over on top so x 5 minus 3 is x to the second power which is what we have two x variables left over so when you're dividing you need to subtract the top exponent by the one on the bottom so for example let's say if we have x to the fifth divided by x to the eighth so it's going to be x to the 5 minus 8 which is x to the negative 3. now when you have a negative exponent to make it positive you can take the x variable and move it to the bottom if you do so the negative 3 will now become positive 3. and typically in the algebra course you want to get rid of any negative exponents you want to make all of them positive now if you want to understand why it works this way you could expand the expression x to the fifth is five x variables multiplied to each other and x to the eight is eight x variables multiplied to each other so we can cancel five on top and five on the bottom so notice that it leaves us with three x variables on the bottom that's why the answer is one over x cubed now when you raise in one exponent to another power we said we need to multiply two times three is six now let's understand why x squared raised to the third power means that we're multiplying three x squareds together whenever you have an exponent what it means is repeat multiplication that's what it represents so we're multiplying x squared three times and x squared means that we're multiplying x two times so in total we're multiplying six x variables that's why it's x to the sixth power and so that's why i got to multiply two and three together now let's look at another example so let's say if we want to multiply x to the fourth power three times so it's x to the fourth times x to the fourth times x to the fourth so basically each x to the fourth represents four x variables multiplied to each other so what we have is a total of 12 x variables so it's x to the 12. so 4 times 3 is 12. so anytime you raise one exponent to another power you need to multiply those two exponents so here's some examples that you could work on go ahead and simplify these problems let's say if we have 5x cubed times 7 x to the fourth and then 28 x to the fifth divided by let's say 40 x squared and 3x to the fourth raised to the second power let's start with the first example 5 times 7 is 35 x cubed times x to the fourth so we need to add the exponents 3 plus 4 is 7. so the answer is 35 x to the 7th now let's move on to the second example 28 is seven times four forty is ten times four now x to the fifth i'm gonna break it down into x cube and x squared because two plus three is five so i can cancel a four and i can cancel x squared so the final answer is going to be seven x cubed divided by 10. now in the next example i need to multiply the exponents 3 is the same as 3 to the first power so 1 times 2 is 2. so i have 3 squared and then 4 times two is eight so this is going to be x to the eighth power three squared is three times three which is nine so the final answer is nine x to the eighth power now let's try some other similar examples try these 30 x to the fifth divided by 48 x to the ninth power and then four x cubed y squared multiplied by three x cubed y to the fifth and finally four x to the fourth y to the fifth raised to the third power so take a minute and work on these examples go ahead and pause the video and once you finish it unpause it and check your work so in the first example i'm going to break down 30 into 6 times 5 and 48 is 6 times 8. x to the knife i'm going to write it as x to the fifth times x to the fourth because 5 plus 4 is 9. and now i'm going to cancel so i can cancel a six and x to the fifth so the final answer is five over eight x to the fourth power now for the next example i need to multiply four by three which is twelve and then x cubed times x cubed 3 plus 3 is 6 and then y squared times y to the fifth which is y to the seventh and so this is the answer 12 x to the 6th y to the 7th now for the last example i need to multiply every exponent by three so one times three is three four times three is twelve five times three is fifteen four to the third is four times four times four four times four is sixteen sixteen times four is sixty-four so the solution is sixty-four x to the twelfth power times y to the fifteenth power now it's important to note that anything raised to the zero power is always one so three x y squared raised to zero is just going to be one now if you have a negative outside of it then this is going to be a negative one now let's say if you're given these three problems i want to make sure you understand the difference and what to do if you ever see this on the test what is the negative 3 squared when the negative is not part of a parenthesis when the negative is not inside of parentheses the two only affects the three not the negative sign so what this means is you have negative and then you're multiplying two threes together three times three three times three is nine so your final answer is just negative nine if you type this in exactly the way you see it in the scientific calculator it's going to give you negative nine now let's look at the next example the negative sign is now inside the parentheses so it's affected by the two so there's two of them we'll multiply negative three by negative three which is positive nine again if you were to type this in exactly the way you see it in a calculator it's going to tell you it's positive 9. now the last example has one negative on the outside and on the inside of multiplying two negative threes together so when you're multiplying three negatives overall it's negative negative three times negative three is positive nine and then negative times positive nine overall is negative nine let's say if you were to see something that looks like this 3x times 5x minus 4 and you're asked to simplify this problem what would you do in this case all you can do is distribute that is to multiply three x to five x and also multiply three x by negative four that's the process of distribution three x times five x three times five is fifteen x times x is x squared and then 3x times negative 4 is negative 12x so that's all you could do in this problem whenever you multiply in one term which is the 3x by two terms then you're distributing or if you're multiplying one term by three terms you're distributed a single term is a monomial two terms is a binomial three terms a trinomial if you have many terms a polynomial so this here is a binomial because there are two terms one two now what if we wanted to let's say we want to multiply a binomial two x plus three by another binomial what should we do in this case we need to foil perhaps you heard of this expression the f stands for first you want to multiply the first two terms and then you want to multiply the stuff on the outside 2x by negative 5 and then the stuff on the inside and then finally the last terms but let's do an order so first let's multiply 2x by 3x so that's going to be 6x squared and then let's multiply the terms on the outside 2x times negative 5 which is negative 10x and then let's multiply the two terms on the inside three times three x which is positive nine x and then finally the last terms three times negative five which is negative fifteen now we need to simplify this algebraic expression so we need to combine like terms negative 10x plus 9x that's going to be negative 10 plus 9 which is like 9 minus 10 that's negative 1. negative 1x and negative x are the same so this is the answer it's 6 x squared minus x minus 15. what about this example what's 3x minus 4 raised to the second power what do you think we need to do in this problem well keep in mind whenever you see an exponent it represents repeat multiplication so what we really have is 3x minus 4 times itself two times so once again we need to foil it three x times three x is nine x squared and then three x times negative four that's negative 12x negative 4 times 3x is also negative 12x and finally negative 4 times negative 4 is positive 16. now just like the last example we're going to combine like terms negative 12x plus negative 12x that's negative 24x and so this is the answer 9x squared minus 24x plus 16. now what about multiplying a binomial by a trinomial go ahead and try this problem now when it gets complicated like this i like to line things up so let me show you 2x times 4x squared that's 8 x cubed so you gotta add one plus two which is three next we have two x times negative three x that's going to be negative six x squared and finally two x times 6 is 12x next we have 5 times 4x squared which is 20x squared i'm going to put it below the negative 6x squared and then 5 times negative 3x that's negative 15x and lastly 5 times 6 which is 30. now the reason why i like to align it like this is i could easily identify the like terms negative 6x squared and 20x squared those are like terms 8x cubed there's nothing else like it that i can combine it with so i'm just going to bring it down negative 6 plus 20 that's positive 14. 12 and negative 15 that adds up to negative 3. so this is the answer 8x cubed plus 14x squared minus 3x plus 30. here's another example 3x squared minus 2x plus 4 times 4x squared plus 5x minus 6. so in this example we're multiplying a trinomial by a trinomial so initially before we combine like terms we should have nine terms because three times three is nine in the last example before we combine like terms we had six terms because two times three is six so let's multiply 3x squared by 4x squared so that's going to be 12 x to the fourth next let's multiply 3x squared by 5x and so that's going to be 15 x cubed and then we're going to multiply 3x squared by negative 6 which is just negative 18 x squared now you got to be careful that you don't make a mistake because the longer the problem the easier it is to make a single mistake which can mess up the whole problem so just you need to double check your work when doing problems like this negative 2x times 4x squared that's negative 8x cubed so i'm going to line it up just to avoid mistakes and then negative two x times five x that's going to be negative 10 x squared next we have negative two x times negative six which is positive twelve x now let's move on to the next part 4 times 4x squared that's positive 16x squared and then 4 times 5x that's 20x and finally 4 times negative 6 which is negative twenty four so as you can see we have a total of nine terms before combining like terms three six nine now we can't combine 12x to the fourth of anything so let's bring it down 15 plus negative 8 that's positive 7 and then negative 10 plus 16 that's positive 6 and negative 18 plus 6 that's going to be negative 12. 12 plus 20 is 32 and so this is the answer 12x to the fourth plus 7x cubed minus 12x squared plus 32x minus 24. now let's talk about solving basic equations you need to master skill especially if you're going to go into an algebra course let's start with this one x plus 8 is equal to 15. x is basically a variable in which you currently don't know what the value of x is a number it represents a specific number so what number plus 8 is equal to 15. well it turns out that seven plus eight is fifteen so therefore x has to be seven now how do we show our work how do we show that x is equal to whenever you need to solve an equation whenever you need to find a value of a variable the best way to do that is to get that variable by itself on any side of the equation so basically if we can move the 8 from the left side to the right side we can get the x variable by itself on the left side and the value that's on the right is going to be equal to the value of x and that's basically what you're doing when you're solving an equation you want to find the value of a variable now the opposite of addition is subtraction so to get rid of the 8 on the left we need to subtract both sides by 8. 8 plus negative 8 is 0. so now what we have left over is x is equal to 15 minus 8 which is 7. and so that's how you could find the value of x let's look at another example x minus 4 is equal to 12. so once again we need to get x by itself on the left side or on the right side to find its value so let's keep it on the left but let's get rid of the negative 4 on the left the opposite of subtraction is addition so we need to add 4 to both sides 12 plus 4 is 16 and you could check the work 16 minus 4 is equal to 12. so x has to be 16. now what about this example if 3x is equal to 15 what is the value of x so how can we separate the 3 from the x how can we get rid of the 3 on the left side well right now the 3 is multiplied to x so if you want to get rid of it from the left side perform the opposite operation of multiplication the opposite of multiplication is division so what you want to do is divide both sides by three three divided by three is one so on the left we're gonna have one x which is the same as x fifteen divided by 3 is 5 and that is the answer x is equal to 5. now if x divided by 6 is equal to 4 what is the value of x the opposite of division is multiplication so in this example we want to multiply both sides by six six divided by six is one so those two numbers will cancel and on the right we have four times 6 which is 24 and so that's the value of x now what about this example two-thirds of x is equal to eight what is the value of x so what you can do is you can multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction so let's multiply the left and the right sides by 3 divided by 2. on the left side the threes will cancel and the twos will cancel so all we have left over is x eight is the same as eight divided by one and you know how to multiply fractions you gotta multiply across so eight times three is twenty four and one times two is two and twenty four divided by two is twelve and this is the answer now let's move on to more difficult examples so sometimes you may need to solve a multi-step equation like this one so if 3x plus 5 is equal to 11 what is the value of x now you don't want to divide everything by three if you do it's just it's not going to be nice instead you want to subtract both sides by 5 first if you do it this way it's going to be a lot easier and with practice you'll get the hang of it eleven minus five is six and now what we can do is divide both sides by three so x is equal to 2. the best way to learn algebra is to make sure to work through the most of the homework problems that can be found in your textbook the more problems you do the better you'll become with math so it's based on the effort that you put in the more effort you put in the more you get out from it try this example let's say 2x minus 7 is equal to 3. find the value of x so we're not going to worry about the two right now let's get rid of the seven on the left side so let's add seven to both sides three plus seven is ten and so two x is equal to ten now once you get to this part you can separate the two and the x by division and ten divided by two is five so this is the solution x is equal to five and you could plug it back in to see if the answer is correct so two times five minus seven is that equal to three two times five is ten and ten minus seven is three so the equation is balanced now let's move on to an example where we have variables on both sides of the equation so let's say that 4x plus 3 is equal to 6x minus 15. now what do you think we need to do in this example your goal is to get all of the x variables on one side and every number that doesn't have an x variable on the opposite side so because six is larger than four i'm going to subtract both sides by four i don't want to deal with negative numbers if i don't have to now at the same time we can add 15 to both sides so all of the variables i'm moving it to the right side i no longer have an x variable on the left side and all of the constants the numbers without a variable is all on the left side 3 plus 15 is 18 6x minus 4x is 2x so once i get to this part of the equation all i need to do is divide both sides by 2. 18 divided by 2 is 9. so as you can see solving equations linear equations is not very difficult you can learn this you can do this now what would you do if you have a linear equation that contains parentheses and variables on both sides so if you see this don't let it concern you you can do this the first thing you should do is distribute so let's multiply 3 by 2x so this is equal to 6x and then multiply 3 by negative 4 which is negative 12. now on the right side distribute the 5. 5 times 3x is 15x and then 5 times 2 that's 10. and let's not forget the negative 3 that we have on the right side so at this point combine like terms if there are any on the right side we can combine 10 minus 3 which is 7. so now we're at the point at the start of the last example 15 is larger than 6 so i'm going to subtract both sides by 6x so i will no longer have a variable on the left side now i want to move all my constants to the left side because the x variable is now on the right side so therefore i need to get rid of the seven so i'm going to subtract both sides by seven so all i have on the right side is 15x minus 6x which is 9x on the left side negative 12 minus 7 which is negative 19. now all you could do at this point is divide by 9. so x is equal to a fraction negative 19 divided by 9. now you may get examples where you have to solve equations that contain fractions so consider this problem 2 two-thirds x plus five is equal to eight what is the value of x now what i like to do is i like to get rid of the fraction from the beginning there's many different ways of going about solving this equation but this is just the method that i prefer i'm going to multiply everything by three by the denominator of this fraction so three times two-thirds the threes will cancel leaving behind simply 2x and then i'm going to multiply 3 by 5 which is 15 and finally 3 times 8 which is 24 and so now i have an equation that is a lot easier to deal with so next i'm going to subtract both sides by 15 and 24 minus 15 that's nine and then divide both sides by two so x is equal to 9 over 2. since the numerator is greater than the denominator we have what is known as an improper fraction so what you can do is you can turn it to a mixed number 9 is basically eight plus one eight divided by two is four and four plus one half is four and one halves as a mixed number so x is basically equal to four point five as a decimal let's try another example three-fourths x minus two-thirds is equal to twelve calculate the value of x now this time there are two fractions in this equation so should we multiply both sides by three or by four if you want to get rid of both fractions you should multiply by both numbers three and four three times four is twelve i'm going to leave it as 4 and 3. so if we multiply this fraction 3 4 by 12 what will we get well the 4s will cancel and so we're left with 3 times three which is simply nine so therefore three fourths x times twelve is going to be nine x now we need to multiply two thirds by 12. so as you can see the threes will cancel and we're left with two times four which is eight and 12 times 12 is 144 now we no longer have any fractions so let's finish the problem let's add 8 to both sides 144 plus 8 is 152 and then we could divide both sides by nine so x is 152 divided by nine now let's turn this into a mixed number and this time i'm going to use the long division so how many times does 9 go into 15 9 goes into 15 one time 9 times 1 is 9 9 times 2 is 18 which exceeds 15. now 15 minus 9 is six so now let's bring down the two nine goes into 62 six times nine times seven is 63 so that's too much nine times six is uh 54 and 62 minus 54 is 8. so to convert this into a mixed number 9 goes into 152 16 times that's going to be the number outside of the fraction and then the denominator is going to stay 9 and then what remains the remainder is the numerator of the mixed fraction so it's 16 and 8 over 9. now other times you may have linear equations that contain decimals i think this is going to be easier than the last example so let's try go ahead and calculate the value of x in this problem now notice that every number is rounded or it's at the the tenths place so therefore multiply everything by ten point eight times ten is eight point three times ten is three point five times ten is five and one point four times ten is fourteen and now it's a lot easier to solve it so let's subtract three from both sides and let's subtract five x from both sides 8x minus 5x is 3x and 14 minus 3 is 11. so the last thing we need to do is divide by 3 so x is equal to eleven over three eleven over three is basically nine over three plus two over three and nine divided by three is three so we got three plus two thirds which as a mixed number is three and two thirds or 3.67 as a decimal now let's look at another example 0.34 x plus 0.12 is equal to 0.26 minus point 15 x go ahead and find the value of x so in this example notice that each number is at the hundreds place so to turn everything into a whole number multiply everything by a hundred point three four x times a hundred is thirty four x and then the next number is going to be twelve and then twenty six minus fifteen x so basically you just gotta move the decimal point two units to the right if you're multiplying a number by 100 now let's solve as we've been doing before so let's add 15x to both sides and let's subtract both sides by 12. 34 plus 15 that's 49. 26 minus 12 is 14. so now let's divide both sides by 49. so x is equal to 14 over 49 which we could simplify that fraction 14 is 7 times 2. 49 is 7 times 7. so therefore x is equal to 2 divided by 7. and so that's the solution for this problem what would you do if you have two fractions separated by an equal sign so let's say x divided by five is equal to eight over nine what is the value of x whenever you have two fractions separated by an equal sign you can cross multiply five times eight is forty and x times nine is nine x and then we could divide by 9. so x is equal to 40 over 9. and that's all you got to do if you have two fractions separate by an equal sign so let me give you another example let's say we have 3x plus 2 divided by five is equal to two x minus five time i mean divided by four calculate the value of x so first cross multiply so we have four times three x plus two and that's equal to five times two x minus five now in this example we need to distribute so let's distribute four to three x plus two four times three x is twelve x and four times two is eight five times two x is ten x and five times negative five is negative twenty five and then it's like another problem that we've seen multiple times so let's subtract both sides by 10x and let's subtract both sides by 8. minus 10x is 2x negative 25 minus 8 is negative 33 and then we'll just divide by 2. so x is equal to negative 33 over 2 which is negative 16.5 as a decimal now you need to be familiar with inequalities that's going to be our next topic of discussion go ahead and graph these four inequalities on a number line so x is greater than two so what does that mean how can we show that on a number line if you look at the second example it means that x is equal to or greater than one let's put a zero here let's put a two if you just have the greater than symbol on a number line you need to draw an open circle so x is greater than two we're gonna put an open circle at two and because it's greater than we're gonna shade towards the right because all of the numbers that are larger than 2 or have a higher value than 2 they're towards the right of 2. now for the second example x is equal to or greater than 1. so we're going to have a closed circle to include one but we're still going to shade to the right because x can be greater than one for the third example x is less than negative two so negative two is to the left of zero and because it's not equal to negative two it doesn't include it we need to use a open circle and shade towards the left because it's less than negative two now for the last example x is less than or equal to negative three so this time we're going to use a closed circle but we're still going to shade towards the left now you need to be able to represent these solutions using interval notation for the first example in the upper left x is greater than 2 so the way you can write it is 2 to infinity all the way to the right you have positive infinity to the left negative infinity so it starts from 2 and it ends at infinity if you have an open circle always use parentheses and for infinity symbols you should always use parentheses now for the example in the upper right this time one is included so we need to use a bracket so it's shaded starting from one and then towards infinity so it's from one to infinity so use brackets if one is included now for the third example on the lower left it's shaded starting from negative infinity to negative two so the way you look at it is from left to right and that's the way you write it from left to right so it's going to be negative infinity to negative two and since we have an open circle we're going to use parentheses as opposed to uh brackets now for the last example it starts from negative infinity and it stops at negative three so it includes negative three so we're going to use brackets there now go ahead and solve these two equations five plus three x is greater than let's say 11. actually let's make it 14. and also solve this one two minus 5x is less than or equal to let's say negative eight now i'm going to start with the example on the left so whenever you're solving an inequality you can treat it as if it's an equation view this as if it was an equal sign so you're going to have 3x is greater than 14 minus 9 i mean 14 minus 5 which is 9 and then divide by 3. so x is greater than 3. now once you get this answer represent it in two ways using a number line and using interval notation so because x is greater than three we're going to shade towards the right and it doesn't equal three so we're gonna use an open circle so in interval notation is from three to infinity now for the example on the right we need to subtract two from both sides so negative five x is less than or equal to negative ten now what we need to do is divide both sides by negative five now here's what we got to be careful whenever you multiply or divide by a negative number you need to switch the sign of the inequality so it's going to change from less than or equal to to greater than or equal to negative 10 divided by negative 5 is positive 2. so this is our answer and now let's plot it on a number line so this time we're going to use a closed circle and we're going to shade towards the right because it can be greater than 2. so an interval notation is from 2 to infinity using brackets since 2 is included so that's it for this video if you want to find more videos on algebra you can check out my udemy course or you could check out my channel for videos in my algebra playlist so thanks again for watching now i want to show you one of my algebra courses that might be useful to you if you ever need it so go to udemy.com now in the search box just type in algebra and it should come up so it's the one with the image with the black background so if you select that option and if you decide to go to course content you can see what's in this particular course so the first section basic arithmetic for those of you who want to focus on addition subtraction multiplication and division and it has a video quiz at the end it's a multiple choice video quiz you can pause

exponential functions logs i have a lot of videos on logs and then this is just functions in general vertical line tests horizontal line tests how to tell for functions even or odd and then conic sections graphene circles hyperbolas ellipses parabolas and things like that there's two video quizzes because it's actually a long section and finally arithmetic and geometric sequences and series so that's my algebra course if you want to take a look at it and uh let me know what you think you ","alright here we are we're gonna look at four different functions polynomial rational exponential and logarithmic now you might be saying hey Proficy we only talked about exponential we what happened to the linear and the quadratic well they're gonna get wrapped up into polynomial functions now at first this equation looks kind of scary so let's just skip the equation for now and we'll talk about the graphs the graphs of a polynomial functions could be linear they could be parabolas or quadratics they could be cubics here's the key they're a smooth curve without any breaks and so I've got some examples here you can see a linear parabola upside down parabola this is probably a cubic this is a polynomial as well so anything that's a smooth curve without any breaks in it is polynomial let's go back and look at the equations so if I looked at a linear it would look something like y equals MX plus B okay so maybe y equals 1/2 X plus 5 and exponential y equals ax squared plus BX plus C and you don't have to memorize these or anything these are just the standard forms that you might have seen before I don't know what this equation is so I'm just completely making this up but if I did y equals x squared plus 3x plus 5 that might be an example there if I get into a cubic that might be something again I'm sure doesn't match but x squared plus 2x minus 2 x squared minus 6x plus 4 okay y equals x to the fourth plus 5x minus R cubed minus 6 x squared plus 2x plus 8 okay now these are not correct equations for these graphs they are just equations and they're just sample equations and what I'm trying to show you here is you see how this X to the fourth X to the third X to the sec next to the first that's what this is saying X to the N X to the N minus 1 so on down to x squared X and then a 0 is a constant these a terms are just numbers and so if you see an equation that looks like this you know it's a polynomial function if you see any graphs that look like this you know it's a polynomial function and really what I want you to be able to do for this section is I want you to be able to look at a graph and say hey I think that's polynomial or I want you to look at equation and say hey I think that equation is polynomial okay so let's move on to rational functions okay so again the goal here remember is just to be able to look at an equation and say hey that equation is a rational function or exponential or logarithmic so the key here with rational function it's a quotient of two polynomials you'll probably think of these as fractions so if you see something like y equals even one over X minus one okay that would be a rational function or y equals x over x squared minus 3x that would be a rational function you see it's a polynomial function divided by a polynomial function okay the graphs they give away on the graphs is that there's either holes or vertical asymptotes you might think of them as breaks in the graph so here's an equation this one is probably going to be similar to y equals 1 over X okay so that would be one example here's another vertical asymptote they might have multiple parts or pieces to it and you can see the vertical asymptotes here and here's another example and so those are rational functions this one is exponential functions easier probably a little more familiar with these equations have X in the exponent that's the key so you might have like y equals 2 times 3 to the X or the one I had earlier is y equals 6 to the X or you can either mean have fractions with them like this I think there was one on the homework a few weeks back 2/5 I think it was five to the eggs something like that anyway exponential functions start off with a horizontal asymptote those are here in both cases and they start off slow and then they explode with growth like the strawberries or else they decay quickly and then taper off in like a half life so that is exponential functions logarithmic functions are another function I want to be able to recognize from the equation these are fairly easy from the equation because they have typically the word log in them so you might have like y equals log base 3 of X or there might be a natural log of X this is a logarithm as well okay so any equation has a log and it is a logarithmic equation these functions have a vertical asymptote and then they level off so they might almost look like they just end kind of funny they might not have an arrow on the end but both of these are the examples of logarithmic functions so just a quick review the goal here is that you would be able to recognize these four functions from their graphs and from their equations so you've got polynomial functions which are linear quadratic cubic quartic okay they're in this format okay their equations smooth without any breaks that's the key they're rational functions are a polynomial function divided by a polynomial function and these typically have breaks in them okay and so you could see these here and their equations have a fraction ah long I skipped one exponential here the equation will have an X in the exponent so it'll look like some of these and it'll have exponential growth or exponential decay the last one then is logarithmic functions I'll have the word log or natural in the equation and those equations will look something like this and so that is the kind of lecture for this section so let me know if you have questions thanks guys ","in this video we're going to focus on the unit circle so in a new circle you need to know that this is the first quadrant this is quadrant two quadrant three and quadrant four perhaps you heard of the expression all students take calculus in quadrant one all sine cosine tangent functions are positive so that's the all part and all students take calculus in quadrant two sine is positive in Quadrant three tangent is positive in Quadrant four cosine is positive those are some things to know cosine is associated with the x value sign is associated with the Y value so this is zero degrees 90 180 270 this is 30 45 and 60 and then there's 120-150 well actually before 1:50 we have 135 and then 150 after 150 the next angle in degrees is to 10 then to 25 and to 40 after which we have 300 315 and 330 now you need to know the angles in radians that correspond to these values so 30 is the same as PI over 6 150 is 5 PI over 6 to 10 is 7 PI over 6 and 330 is 11 PI over 6 all of these share the same reference angle which is 30 degrees next you have the PI over 4 so 45 is 1 PI over 4 135 is 3 PI over 4 to 25 is 5 PI over 4 and 315 that's 7 PI over 4 and now 60 is PI over 3 or 1 PI over 3 120 is double that amount so that's 2 PI over 3 240 is 4 PI over 3 and 300 is 5 PI over 3 90 is PI over 2 180 is PI and 270 is 3 PI over 2 0 and 360 are coterminal angles 360 is also equal to 2 pi by the way so now we need to do is go over the values that correspond to these angles you need to know the XY coordinates so for zero the coordinates are 1 comma 0 xxx its X is going to be root 3 over 2 and Y is 1/2 at 45 its root 2 over 2 and that's 60 it's going to be 1/2 comma root 3 over 2 and at 90 its 0 comma 1 now if you know the values for the first quadrant it's going to be the same for the other quadrants input the signs may change so in Quadrant 2 X is negative but Y is positive so notice that you have 1 0 on the right side 180 is going to be negative 1 0 now I 30 we have root 3 over 2 comma one half at 150 it's going to be very similar only X is going to be negative so it's going to be negative root 3 over 2 comma positive 1/2 135 shares the same reference angle as 45 so therefore they're going to have the same values so it's going to be negative root 2 over 2 comma root 2 over 2 and 120 and 60 they share the same reference angle so it's going to be negative 1/2 and positive root 3 over 2 so as you can see the values on the left is the same as the values on the right don't difference is the x value is a negative so now let's look at quadrant 3 we're going to have the same values but x and y are both negative so at 210 210 150 and 30 they share the same reference angle so the values is going to be the same but it's going to be negative root 3 over 2 comma negative 1/2 225 is similar to 45 but negative so negative root 2 over 2 comma negative root 2 over 2 and 240 similar to 60 so we're going to have negative 1/2 and negative 3 over 2 now 0 1 2 7 is opposite to 90 so instead of being 0 1 we're going to have 0 negative 1 okay now for the quadrant 4 angles 330 is similar to 30 they share the same reference angle but Y is negative in Quadrant 4 X is positive so it's going to be positive 3 positive root 3 over 2 comma negative 1/2 and 315 is similar to 45 but X I mean but Y is still negative so it's root 2 over 2 comma negative root 2 over 2 and 300 has a reference angle of 60 so it's going to be 1/2 comma negative root 3 over 2 so x and y are positive in Quadrant 1 in Quadrant 2 X is negative Y is positive in Quadrant 3 x and y are both negative or in Quadrant 4 X is positive Y is negative so that's the unit circle but sometimes it may be difficult to memorize the unit circle so there's another technique that can help you if you need to evaluate a sine cosine or tangent function but before we get into that let's talk about how to use the unit circle to evaluate sine and cosine so let's say if we want to figure out what's sine of 60 is sine is associated with the Y value sine of 60 is root 3 over 2 cosine is associated with the x value cosine 60 is 1/2 now if you want to find tangent 60 tangent 60 is y over X is going to be root 3 over 2 divided by 1/2 the twos are going to cancel so tan 60 is simply root 3 so here's another example let's say if we want to evaluate sine 180 sine is going to be the Y value sine 180 is zero cosine 180 is the x value it's negative one tangent 180 is y over X it's 0 over negative 1 which is 0 now let's say if we want to evaluate 300 sine I mean not 300 but 330 sine 330 is negative 1/2 is the Y value cosine 330 that's positive root 3 over 2 tangent 330 is negative 1/2 divided by root 3 over 2 it's Y over X the twos will cancel so it's going to be negative 1 over root 3 and if you rationalize it it's going to be negative root 3 over 3 so that's how you can use the unit circle to evaluate sine cosine and tangent functions if you have a memorized but now let's talk about how to evaluate trig functions if we don't have the unit circle or if we don't have it memorized so let's say if we want to evaluate sine of 30 degrees how can we do so without the help of the unit circle so you need to know the 30-60-90 triangle and this would commit it to memory is going to be very helpful across the 30 here's one across the 60 is root 3 across the 90 or the hypotenuse it's 2 now there's something called sylco Toa and we're going to focus on the cell part because S stands for sine sine sine of an angle let's say theta is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse side o stands for opposite H stands for hypotenuse a stands for adjacent so sine theta is opposite divided by hypotenuse so we're looking for sine 30 opposite to 30 is 1 so 1 is opposite to it 2 is the hypotenuse root 3 is adjacent to 30 so sine 30 is opposite which is 1 divided by the hypotenuse which is across the box so that's 2 so sine 30 is 1/2 and if you go to the unit circle if you locate 30 and if you look at the y-coordinate it should be 1/2 so now let's say if we wish to evaluate cosine of 30 degrees so now we need to you look at the car part of silver Toller so cosine is equal to adjacent divided by hypotenuse adjacent is root 3 so it's going to be root 3 divided by the hypotenuse which is 2 so cosine 30 is root 3 over 2 now the next thing we're going to look at is tangent of 30 so if we focus on a total part tan 30 its opposite over adjacent opposite is 1 adjacent is root 3 so it's going to be 1 divided by root 3 now you don't want to have a radical on the bottom in the denominator of a fraction so what you want to do is you want to rationalize it you want to multiply top and bottom by root 3 so 1 times root 3 well that's just 3 3 root 3 times root 3 is the square root of 9 and the square root of 9 is 3 so tan 30 is root 3 over 3 now the next thing needs to be familiar with is the 45 45 90 degree triangle across the 45 is a 1 and across the 90 degree angle or die potenuse is root 2 so if you want to evaluate let's say sine of 45 sine of 45 you can use any of the 45 angles its opposite which is 1 divided by the hypotenuse of root 2 and you do have to rationalize it but when you do you're going to get root 2 over 2 sine 45 that's what it is root 2 over 2 cosine 45 is going to be the same thing it's going to be adjacent and divided by hypotenuse which is 1 over root 2 which rationalize 2 root 2 over 2 root 2 over 2 now tangent 45 what do you think tangent 45 is so tangent is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side so opposite is 1 and adjacent is 1 so it's 1 over 1 tan 45 is simply 1 well that's great but what if we have an angle that's not in Quadrant 1 so for example let's say if we wish to evaluate sine of 120 120 it's not part of the 30-60-90 triangle so how can we do this now there's something called the reference angle and that's what you want to use in this situation the reference angle in Quadrant 1 is the same as the angle in quadrant 1 so you don't need it if your angles in quadrant one in quadrant two the reference angle is 180 minus the angle in quadrant 2 in quadrant three the reference angle is the angle minus 180 and in Quadrant 4 the reference angle is 360 minus the angle in quadrant 4 so let's draw it so 120 that's going to be somewhere in quadrant 2 so this angle is 120 notice that it forms a reference angle of 60 degrees the reference angle is the angle between the hypotenuse of the triangle and the x-axis so we could turn this into a triangle if you want so notice that we get the 30-60-90 triangle so across the 30 we said is a 1 across the 60 is root 3 and across the 90 is the 2 now because the triangle is in Quadrant 2 we know X is negative y is positive so we're going to put negative 1 here and leave this as positive root 3 the hypotenuse is always going to be positive so sine of 120 is equal to sine of 60 the only thing you have to worry about is if it's going to be positive or negative now sine cosine or tangent of any reference angle which is always between 0 and 90 it's going to be positive because everything is positive in Quadrant 1 so sine 60 is positive now sine 120 sine is associated with the Y value so assigned positive or negative in Quadrant 2 notice that in Quadrant 2 the Y value goes up so therefore Y is positive which means that sine 120 is positive so sine is positive in Quadrant 2 remember all students take calculus the S part is for quadrant 2 sine is positive so sine 120 is equal to positive sine 60 so now using sohcahtoa we can evaluate sine 60 so it's going to be opposite opposite to 60 is the positive root 3 divided by the hypotenuse which is 2 so sine 60 and therefore sine 120 is root 3 over 2 now it's your turn evaluate cosine of 240 so 240 is in Quadrant three so that's 240 degrees and this is 180 so keep in mind a reference angle in Quadrant three it's equal to the quadrant three angle minus 180 so it's 240 minus 180 which is 60 so this angle inside the triangle is 60 degrees so if we turn it to a right triangle this is going to be 90 and the other angle is 30 so we have the 30-60-90 triangle again now across the 30 we have a one across the 60 is root three across the 90s two now 240 is in Quadrant three so x and y are both negative so we can see that cosine 240 is equal to is associated with cosine 60 because 60 is our reference angle but cosine is negative in Quadrant three so let's put a negative sign so now let's evaluate it so cosine is adjacent divided by hypotenuse adjacent to the 60 is negative one and hypotenuse is 2 so it's going to be negative one over two keep in mind cosine 60 is positive one over two but we need to add the negative sign so overall it should be negative one over two because cosine 242 40s in Quadrant three and cosine is negative over all in Quadrant dream so that's cosine 240 negative 1/2 and you can confirm it with the unit circle so try this one tangent of 330 what's tangent of 330 now tangent is y over X or it's also opposite over hypotenuse but let's draw so 330 is going to be somewhere over here so this entire angle is 330 degrees now the reference angle in Quadrant 4 is 360 minus the angle in quadrant four then the angle is 330 so therefore we have a reference angle of 30 degrees so now we can turn this into a triangle the 30-60-90 triangle across the 30 is one across the 60 is root 3 and hypotenuse is always 2 now in Quadrant 4 X is positive but Y is negative as you go to the right you can see X is positive but Y is going down towards the negative zone so tangent 330 is going to be a negative value because tangent is negative in quadrants two and four but tangent is positive in one and three so it's going to negative 1030 so now let's focus on tan 30 tangent is opposite opposite to 30 is negative 1 divided by adjacent adjacent or next to 30 is root 3 so it's going to be negative 1 over root 3 overall tangent is negative in Quadrant 4 now let's rationalize it let's multiply top and bottom by root 3 so therefore tan 330 is negative root 3 over 3 try this one cosine 225 so 225 is in Quadrant three and sine and cosine are negative in Quadrant three so notice the difference between 225 in the x axis 225 - 180 that's a 45 difference so what we have is the 45-45-90 triangle so across the 45 is one and across the 90 is root 2 because this is in Quadrant three x and y are both negative so cosine 225 is the same as negative cosine 45 and cosine 225 is going to be adjacent doesn't matter which 45 you pick let's pick this one so adjacent it's negative 1 divided by the hypotenuse root 2 and don't forget to rationalize it so cosine 225 is negative root 2/2 so now let's say if you get an angle that is not part of the special triangles either the 30-60-90 triangle or the 45-45-90 time so for example let's say if you need to evaluate tangent 90 how would you do it so you can't really draw a triangle for this you simply need to know that at 90 degrees the XY coordinate on a unit circle is 0 comma 1 and tangent is y divided by X tangent is sine divided by cosine so it's sine 90 over cosine 90 now it turns out that sine 90 is the y-coordinate it's 1 cosine 90 is 0 whenever you get a 0 in the denominator of a fraction is undefined so tangent 90 is undefined if you were to type in tan 90 in your calculator is going to tell you what are you doing it's going to be going to get an error so tan 90 is undefined tan 270 is also undefined cotangent of 0 and 180 are undefined as well so just make sure you're aware of that you never know you might see that on the test now let's say if you want to evaluate sine of 5 PI over 6 how would you do it so here we have the angle in radians and if you're going to use the unit circle you can simply take the paper and just simply find out what the y-coordinate is and get the answer so keep in mind you can go to Google Images and type in unit circle and just print it out and memorize it but if you want to use the 30-60-90 triangle here's what you need to do let's convert radians into degrees in order to do this you need to multiply the angle in radians by 180 over pi so notice that the PI's will cancel so 180 is basically 18 times 10 and 18 is 6 times 3 so we can cancel a 6 so we have leftover is 5 times 3 which is 15 and 15 times 10 that's 150 so therefore 5 PI over 6 is equal to 150 degrees so we're looking for a sign of 150 so let's draw it 150 is in Quadrant two and it's 30 degrees away from 180 so the reference angle is 30 so we can draw the triangle so we have another 30-60-90 triangle across the 30 is one across the 60 is root three across the 90s two now in Quadrant two we know that X is negative but Y is positive so now sine 150 is associated with sine 30 so let's focus on the 30 degree angle the reference angle so sine is opposite over hypotenuse based on sohcahtoa so opposite to the 30 is 1 and the hypotenuse is 2 so therefore sine of 150 which is the same as sine 5 PI over 6 it's 1/2 and you could check that with the unit circle so now it's your turn try this example what is cosine of 11 PI over 6 so let's convert radians into degrees so let's multiply by 180 over PI so we can cancel the PI's now 18 divided by 6 is 3 so 180 divided by 6 is 30 so we have is 11 times 13 11 is 10 plus 1 so let's distribute the 30 30 times 10 is 330 times 1 is 30 so this is 330 so we have here is cosine 330 now let's go ahead and plot it on a graph so 330 is in Quadrant 4 and this is 360 or 0 degrees so we have a 30 degree reference angle so it's a 30-60-90 triangle again across the 30 is a 1 across the 60 is root 3 across the 90s - when watching 4 X is positive but Y is negative so we need to focus on the 30 because that's a reference angle so based on sohcahtoa it's cosine 330 is going to be adjacent over hypotenuse adjacent is root 3 hypotenuse is 2 so it's positive root 3 over 2 so that's the same as cosine 11 PI over 6 now let's say if you have tangent negative 150 how would you evaluate it what's tan negative 150 so what you can do is convert the negative angle into a positive angle by looking for the positive coterminal angle a coterminal angle is simply another number but it's an angle that lands in the same position so the find the coterminal angle simply add 360 to a negative angle negative 150 plus 360 that's going to be 210 so negative 150 and 210 are coterminal angles they occupy the same position on the number I mean on the unit circle so 210 is in Quadrant three and here's 180 so the reference angle is 30 so we have a 30-60-90 triangle so across the 30 is one across the 60 is root 3 across the 90s - and x and y are both negative so he needs to understand this positive 210 is 210 degrees going this way a positive angle rotates counterclockwise in the opposite direction of a clock negative 150 you need to go the other way this is negative 150 notice that you end it the same location negative 150 is a clockwise rotation it follows the direction of a clock but these two angles you can see that if you add negative 150 plus 360 to get the 210 so it looks like a full circle so now let's evaluate tangent 210 based on sohcahtoa tangent is opposite over hypotenuse and the reference angle of 210 because he is 30 so opposite is negative 1 I might have said opposite over hypotenuse but if I did its opposite over adjacent so cut to 1 so I meant to say opposite of adjacent so opposite is negative 1 divided by Jason is which is negative root 3 and so the negatives cancel so it's positive 1 over root 3 and if we rationalize it it's going to be root 3 over 3 so that's tangent of negative 150 now let's say if you have secant let's say 300 how would you evaluate secant 300 you need to know that secant theta is equal to 1 over cosine and you need to know the other functions cosecant theta is 1 over sine theta and cotangent theta is 1 over tangent which is also the same as cosine over sine keep my tangent is sine over cosine but cotangent is cosine of a sine so if you want to evaluate secant you need to evaluate cosine secant is 1 over cosine so what's cosine of 300 so let's draw our picture 300 is somewhere over here and so the difference between 300 and the x-axis which is 360 we can see that we have a reference angle of sixteen so across the 30 is one across the 60 is root three across hypotenuse is 2 so X is positive in quadrant one but y is negative because y is going down in Quadrant four I'm going to stay quadrant 4 not quadrant one so in quadrant four X is positive but Y is negative so cosine 300 is associated with cosine 60 and cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse based on sohcahtoa so adjacent to 60 is 1 and the hypotenuse is 2 so cosine 300 is going to be positive 1 over 2 so keep in mind cosine is positive in Quadrant 1 and 4 because X is positive on the right side the cosine is negative in quadrants two and three because X is negative on the left side so if cosine 300 is 1/2 secant 300 is reciprocal of cosine it's going to be 2 over 1 and so that's the answer for that so now let's try another one let's say if we wish to evaluate cosecant of 240 feel free to pause the video and see if you can figure this one out see if you can get the answer cosecant is 1 over sine or 1 over sine 240 so let's draw 240 240 is in Quadrant 3 so two 40s over here it differs from the x-axis 180 by 60 so the reference angle 60 and this angle here is 30 so across the 30 is 1 across the 60 is root 3 across the 90s too so both x and y are negative in Quadrant 3 so if you wish to evaluate sine 240 we need to focus on the reference angle the 60 based on sohcahtoa sine is opposite divided by hypotenuse so therefore sine 240 is negative root 3 divided by 2 so that's the case for sine 240 then what is cosecant 2 for equal 2 so it's going to be the reciprocal of this fraction so we just got to flip that fraction so it's going to be negative 2 over radical 3 now we have a radical on the bottom so we do need to rationalize it let's multiply the top and bottom by 3/3 so cosecant 240 is negative 2 root 3 divided by 3 so that's the answer for that so let's say if you want to evaluate cotangent of 600 how would you do it so if you get a very large angle subtract it by 360 get the coterminal angle 600 minus 360 is 240 so we're looking for a cotangent of 240 so let's draw the triangle so 240 is somewhere over here and it differs by 60 from 180 so we have a 30-60-90 triangle this is negative one negative root three and two so if tangent is opposite over adjacent and cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent then cotangent must be adjacent over opposite so looking at the 16 adjacent to the 60 is negative one and opposite to the 60 is negative root three so co'tin of 240 which is the same as kill 10 600 it's 1 over root 3 and if we rationalize it it's going to be root 3 over 3 so keep in mind tangent 600 would be root 3 over 1 but cotangent of 600 is 1 over root 3 which is root 3 over 3 this reciprocal of tangent so now let's say if we have secant let's say negative 11 PI over 6 so what would you do so we have a negative angle and it's in radians and we have a secant function so how would you figure out this one so let's go ahead and convert radians into degrees so let's not worry about the negative sign right now so let's multiply by 180 over PI now I believe we did this one writing 180 over 6 is 30 30 times 11 is 330 so this is negative 330 now because it's negative let's add 360 to it to make it positive negative 330 plus 360 that's positive 30 which is a reference angle because it's an acute angle between 0 and 90 so we're looking for secant 30 so whenever you want to evaluate secant you want to find out cosine because secant is 1 divided by cosine so here we could just draw a generic 30-60-90 triangle because we're looking for cosine 30 across the 30 is 1 across the six days root 3 across the 90s 2 so cosine is adjacent divided by hypotenuse so cosine 30 is adjacent which is root 3 divided by the hypotenuse of 2 therefore secant 30 is the reciprocal of cosine 30 so it's 2 over root 3 and if we rationalize it we're going to get the answer to root 3 over 3 and so now you know how to evaluate secant cosecant and cotangent functions as well as sine cosine and tangent functions now here's the question for you let's say if sine theta is equal to 3 over 5 how can you find the other five trig functions cosine tangent secant cosecant cotangent so if sine is 3 over 5 draw a triangle in Quadrant 1 sine is opposite over hypotenuse so the opposite is the 3 part the hypotenuse is 5 this is the 3 4 5 triangle if you use the Pythagorean theorem you could come up with the same equation it's a squared plus B squared is equal to C squared so it's 3 squared plus the missing side squared which we'll call B squared and we have the hypotenuse which is five three squared is nine and five squared that's five times five which is twenty five 25 minus 9 is 16 and the square root of 16 is 4 so this we have the 3 4 5 triangle once you find the third side of the triangle you could find the other trig functions so cosine theta is adjacent divided by hypotenuse so that's four over five and tangent theta is opposite over adjacent so that's three over four so now that we have that we can find the others cosecant theta is the reciprocal of sine and if sine theta is 3 over five cosecant is five over 3 just flip it and secant is the reciprocal of cosine so that's going to be five over four and cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent so if tangent is three over four co'tin is four over three so now let's say if cosine theta is negative seven over 25 and let's say the angle let's say theta is less than 180 but greater than 90 what quadrant is the angle in between 90 and 180 the quadrant is number two so let's draw a triangle in Quadrant two so here's theta now cosine is negative 7 over 25 based on sohcahtoa we know that cosine is adjacent divided by hypotenuse so therefore this is negative 7 and this is 25 keep in mind X is negative in Quadrant 2 anytime you go to the left the X values are negative so now what's the missing side you need to know your special triangles so we went over the 3 4 5 triangle the next one is the 5 12 13 triangle and there's the 8 15 17 triangle and a 7 24:25 triangle so the missing side is 24 there's some other special triangles - I've seen like the 940 41 and also there's the 11 60 61 prime so now that we have cosine we can find the other stuff so sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse opposite is 24 so it's 24 over 25 tangent theta is opposite over adjacent that's 24 over negative 7 so secant theta is the reciprocal of cosine so that's going to be negative 25 over 7 and cosecant theta is the reciprocal of sine so that's 25 over 24 and finally cotangent theta is the reciprocal of tangent so it's negative 7 over 24 so now it's your turn let's say if tangent theta is equal to 8 over 15 and theta is less than 270 degrees but greater than 180 so the first thing you need to find is the quadrant so clearly this is quadrant dream so let's draw a triangle in quadrant dream so here's our box and here's theta so this is the 8 15 17 triangle opposite to theta is the 8 adjacent is 15 the hypotenuse is 17 in Quadrant 3 x and y are negative so now let's find sine theta sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse opposite is negative 8 adjacent 19:15 hypotenuse is 17 so it's going to be negative 8 over 17 cosine theta that's the jacent over hypotenuse so negative 15 over 17 cotangent theta the reciprocal of tangent so that's 15 over 8 and cosecant that's going to be negative 17 over 8 and Sica negative 17 over 15 now let's say that secant theta is let's say it's 13 over 5 and let's say that sine theta is less than zero go ahead and find the other five trig functions feel free to pause the video now the first thing we need to do is identify the quadrant so if secant is positive that means cosine is positive because cosine is 1 over secant and sine is negative in which quadrant is cosine positive and sine negative cosine is associated with X sine is associated of Y so if X is positive we need to go to the right and if sine or Y is negative you need to go down so therefore this is in Quadrant four so theta is over here now C CAP it is 13 over five which means that cosine is 5 over 13 so the adjacent side is five hypotenuse is 13 the missing side must be 12 but notice that Y is going down so it's negative 12 so now we can find sine theta that's a negative 12 over 13 and cosecant theta is 1 over sine so that's going to be negative 13 over 12 tangent theta is opposite over adjacent so that's negative 12 over 5 and co'tin theta is negative 5 over 12 now sometimes may not have us but your triangle to go by so let's say if sine theta is two over five and let's say it's in quadrant one go ahead and find the other trig functions so we're going to follow the same pattern so opposite is two and the hypotenuse is 5 what's the missing side so if we use the Pythagorean theorem we could say that a is 2 we're looking for B and C is 5 so 2 squared is 4 5 squared is 25 25 minus 4 is 21 so B squared is equal to 21 which means that B is the square root of 21 so that's the missing side so now let's find cosine cosine beta is going to be adjacent over hypotenuse so that's root 21 over 5 tangent theta that's opposite over adjacent it's 2 over root 21 and you got to rationalize it so this is going to be 2 root 21 over 21 now if you want to find cotangent theta don't flip this fraction flip this one it's easier so cotangent theta it's going to be just root 21 over 2 so you don't have to rationalize anymore secant theta is 1 of a cosine so it's going to be 5 over root 21 and that you do have to rationalize so that's going to be 5 root 21 over 21 and finally the other one cosecant theta it's just 5 over 2 now let's say it's cosine theta is let's say it's three over five and let's say the quadrant is one again so we know this is three this is five the missing side is 4 3 4 5 triangle but using this if cosine is 3 over 5 how can you find the double angle sine 2 theta there's a formula for this sine 2 theta is 2 sine theta cosine theta and we know that sine based on the triangle it's opposite over hypotenuse so it's 4 over 5 and we already have the value for cosine that's 3 over 5 2 is the same as 2 over 1 4 times 3 is 12 times 2 is 24 so it's 24 over 25 that's how you can evaluate the double angle using the triangle now if you want to find cosine 2 theta we can use the equation cosine squared minus sine squared cosine squared that's 3 over 5 squared sine squared sine is 4 over 5 3 squared is 9 5 squared is 25 4 squared is 16 9 minus 16 is negative 7 so it's negative 7 over 25 now if you want to find tangent to theta you can simply just divide sine 2 theta by cosine 2 theta so we have the value of sine two theta in the last example we said it was 24 over 25 and we have the value of cosine 2 theta it's a negative 7 over 25 if you multiply the top fraction by 25 and the bottom by 25 the 20 fives will cancel so tangent 2 theta is simply negative 24 / 7 by the way if you want more examples I've created another video on if it believes entitled trigonometry precalculus overview review tests something like that it's somewhere on YouTube and it covers a lot of examples on trigonometry and questions like what we're dealing with right now and there's another one verifying trigonometric identity you can check out those videos because that topic most students have great difficulty with so if you ever come to a point where you have to know how to prove one side is equal to the other side if you have to prove or verify the identity check out the video I've created one might be of great help to you so now let's move on to our next topic so let's say if sine theta is equal to X divided by 3 what is the value of cosine theta sometimes you make you may see a question like this and if you do huh what do you do how do how do you solve so let's draw a triangle and let's assume that it's in quadrant one because everything is positive if there's no negative sign assume it's in quadrant one so here's theta and now we know that sine is opposite over hypotenuse so you got to find a missing side so let's solve for B we'll call B is massage so a squared plus B squared is equal to C squared according to the Pythagorean theorem so a is X we're looking for B C squared that's 3 squared which 9 so to isolate B squared we need to subtract both sides by x squared so B squared is 9 minus x squared and to solve for B we got to take the square root so B let me get rid of this B here so therefore B is the square root of 9 minus x squared so now we can figure out what cosine is so cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse so that's radical 9 minus x squared over 3 and that's how you do it so if I want to find tangent its opposite over adjacent opposite so theta is X adjacent is root 9 minus x squared so it's going to be x over root 9 minus x squared and you can use the find the other stuff cosecant is the reciprocal of sine so cosecant is 3 over X secant is the reciprocal of cosine that's 3 over radical 9 minus x squared and you can rationalize it if you want to and cotangent that's going to be radical 9 minus x squared divided by X now the last thing that we need to talk about is inverse functions so for example sine 30 if you use the unit circle if you look for the Y value sine 30 is 1/2 so therefore the inverse sine of 1/2 is 30 so sine of an angle is equal to a value 30 degrees is the angle 1/2 is the value the inverse sine of a value is the angle whenever you're dealing with an inverse function basically you need to switch two variables you would switch X and Y in this case we're switching the angle the value but now you have to be careful because the inverse functions has limitations was a sine function its domain goes on forever from negative infinity to infinity so here's an example to illustrate that sine of 150 is also 1/2 however the inverse sine of 1/2 and this is important it does not equal 150 question is why well as we mentioned before the inverse function has a restricted domain so let's go over the rules that you need to know regarding inverse functions and their restrictions so whenever you're dealing with the inverse function sine can only be in quadrants one and four in camp in quadrant two and 150 is in quadrant two and that's why the inverse sine of 1/2 doesn't give you 150 it gives you 30 because 30 is in quadrant one so inverse sine only works in one and four and you need to know the angles and that it's between negative 90 and 90 so let's say if you want to find the inverse sine of negative 1/2 well we know that sine is negative in Quadrant four and we know that sine 330 is negative 1/2 however the inverse sine does not equal 330 even though 330 is in Quadrant four 330 is not between negative 90 and 90 inverse sine is limited between negative 90 and 90 now sine of negative 30 is also negative 1/2 negative 30 and 330 are coterminal angles they're both right here you can go 330 in this direction or you can go negative 30 in this direction so their co-terminal almost they differ by 360 so they're both in Quadrant 4 however negative 30 is in the range of negative 90 to 90 that's the range of the inverse sine function so negative 30 works so the inverse sine of negative 1/2 is indeed negative 30 and not 330 even though both are in the right quadrant negative 30 is in the restricted domain of inverse sine which is between negative 90 and 90 so make sure you're aware of that the next trig function that we need to talk about is inverse cosine inverse cosine exist between quadrant one and two so the restricted domain for inverse cosine is from zero to 180 and for inverse tangent it's like inverse sine its quadrant one and four so none of them exist in quadrant three for the inverse functions so sine and tangent is from negative 90 to 90 quadrant two running for inverse cosine is quadrant one and two from zero to 180 so knowing that let's evaluate inverse cosine of 1/2 feel free to pause the video and figure out what inverse cosine of 1/2 is so we know that cosine of 60 is 1/2 and also cosine of 300 is 1/2 now 300 is in Quadrant four and inverse cosine it doesn't exist in Quadrant four so we can't use a 300 so it's 60 so inverse cosine of 1/2 is 60 now what about inverse cosine of negative root 3 over 2 so cosine of if you use the unit circle and you look at the x-values cosine of 150 is negative root 3 over 2 cosine is negative in quadrants two and three and cosine two 10 is also negative root three over two however 210 is in Quadrant three so we can't use that so therefore it's 150 150 is in Quadrant two and it's within the restricted domain this between 0 and 180 so now what about inverse tangent of 1 so this has to be in quadrant one because it's positive in verse 10 is positive in Quadrant 1 and if you use the unit circle it's 45 now what about inverse tangent of negative root 3 what about that one so tangent is negative in quadrants two and four tan 120 is negative root three and tan of 300 is also negative root three and also tan negative 60 is also negative root three so in verse 10 is negative in Quadrant four we can't use 120 now 300 and negative 60 is in Quadrant four but we can't use 300 because it's outside of the restricted domain it has to be between negative 90 and 90 so negative 16 fits the requirements and so that's the answer so whenever you're dealing with inverse sine and inverse tangent in quadrant 4 the angle is going to be between negative 90 to zero it's not going to be between 270 and 360 make sure you do not pick that answer so that is it for this video we've covered a lot of trig and hopefully you found it to be educational so thanks for watching and have a great day ","now let's start the video quiz for each of these problems pause the video and work on it once you have your answer unpause it to see the solution so let's go ahead and begin for number one if we plug in 2 notice that we will get 4 in the bottom we won't get a 0 in the denominator of the fraction so therefore we can use direct substitution to get the answer so let's replace x with 2 so it's going to be 2 squared plus 7 times 2 plus 6 divided by 2 plus 2. now 2 squared is 4 7 times 2 is 14 plus 6 and 2 plus 2 is 4. now 4 14 plus 6 is 20 and 20 plus 4 that's 24 and 24 divided by that number was supposed to be 4. 24 divided by 4 is 6. so this is the value of the limit which means that answer choice b is the correct answer number two find the value of the limit shown below now if we try to use direct substitution in the denominator we're going to get a zero so we don't want to do that what we need to do is factor so how can we factor the numerator what two numbers multiply to negative 15 but add to the middle coefficient of positive two this is going to be positive five and negative three so to factor it's gonna be x plus five times x minus three now on the bottom we can factor x squared minus nine because they're perfect squares the square root of x squared is x and the square root of nine is three one of them is going to be plus the other is going to be minus notice that we can cancel x minus 3. so now we can evaluate the limit as x approaches 3 of x plus 5 divided by x plus three so it's going to be three plus five divided by three plus three and so that's eight divided by six which reduces to four divided by three if you divide both numbers by two so therefore d is the right answer number three calculate the value of the limit shown below so whenever you have a complex fraction what you want to do is multiply the top and the bottom by the common denominator the common denominator being 4x so on the top you want to distribute 4x times one over x is four four x is the same as four x over one and you can see the x variables will cancel leaving behind four so therefore we now have is the limit as x approaches four and on top we have positive four now if we multiply four x by one over four you can see that the fours will cancel leaving behind x and there's a negative sign in front so it's going to be minus x and on the bottom we're just going to rewrite x minus 4 and 4 minus x now these two factors look very similar but they're not exactly the same so what we're going to do is we're going to factor out a negative 1. if we do so negative x will change into positive x and positive 4 will change into negative 4. and it's at this point that we can get rid of the x minus four so now we have the limit as x approaches four of negative one divided by four x now we can use direct substitution so this is going to be negative 1 over 4 times 4 which gives us a final answer of negative 1 divided by 16 which means c is the right answer number four find the value of the limit so here we have a rational function with a square root on the top in a situation like this you need to multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the numerator the conjugate is going to be the same thing but you got to change the negative sign into a positive sign and whatever you do to the top you must also do to the bottom now on top we're going to foil the square root of x times the square root of x is equal to x the square root of x times 4 that's going to be positive 4 square root x and negative 4 times the square root of x is going to be what you see here and finally we have negative 4 times 4 which is negative 16. in the denominator we're not going to foil we're just going to rewrite what we have so we can see that the two middle terms add up to zero and they're going to disappear so now what we have is the limit as x approaches 16 of x minus 16 divided by x minus 16 times the square root of x plus four so now we can cancel x minus sixteen and at this point we can replace x with sixteen so this is going to be one divided by the square root of sixteen plus four the square root of sixteen is four and four plus four is eight so the answer is one divided by eight which corresponds to answer choice a number five evaluate the limit so we can't plug in seven if we plug in seven it's gonna be zero over zero which is indeterminate and we don't know if that's equal to zero infinity doesn't exist or one or negative one so we need to check the left side and the right sided limit so let's start with the left side as x approaches seven from the left let's call this f of x so we're going to substitute a number that's close to 7 but from the left let's use 6.9 6.9 minus 7 is negative point one and the absolute value of negative point one is positive point one and when you divide that by negative point one you're going to get negative one so therefore that is the limit as x approaches seven from the left side it's equal to negative one now what about from the right side what is the limit as x approaches seven from the right side so let's plug in a number that's greater than 7 but close to it let's try 7.1 so 7.1 minus 7 is equal to positive 0.1 and the absolute value of positive 0.1 is positive 0.1 divided by itself that's going to equal positive 1. so notice that the left side and the right side do not match so therefore the limit does not exist which means e is the answer number six what is the value of the limit of the trigonometric function shown below just by looking at it it's going to be 3 divided by 5 for those of you who just want a quick answer so it turns out answer choice b is the right answer but let's do some work to get our answer so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to replace tangent with sine divided by cosine so tan 3x is sine 3x divided by cosine 3x and we still have this 5x on the bottom so i can write it as 1 over 5x now what i need to have under sine 3x is a 3x i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by 3. so i'm going to trade places with the cosine and the 3 i'm also going to move the x in that position as well so this is all equal to the limit as x approaches 0 sine three x divided by three x times the limit as x approaches zero i still have a three on top and already move the 3x to the left so on the bottom i have a 5 and a cosine 3x which i'm going to write as 1 over cosine 3x so now i'm going to use substitution let's say that y is equal to 3x so therefore this limit expression becomes the following expression the limit as y approaches 0 of sine y divided by y times the limit as x approaches zero and here this is a function based on x so this is gonna be one over cosine three x times three over five now the limit as y approaches zero of sine y divided by y that's equal to one you just need to know that formula you can always plug in a small value of x and you can confirm that as one cosine zero if we replace x with zero three times zero is still zero cosine zero is equal to one but i'll replace that in the next step so what we have is one times one times three over five which gives us a final answer of three divided by five so therefore answer choice b is the right answer number seven find the horizontal asymptote of the function shown below using limits to do so we need to find the limit as x approaches infinity of the function 5x plus 8x squared divided by three x plus two x squared plus five now keep in mind when x becomes very large five x is insignificant compared to eight x squared if you replace x with a thousand five thousand is not significant to eight million and three is not significant to two million so therefore this expression becomes equivalent to the limit as x approaches infinity of eight x squared divided by two x squared plus five you can only do this when x becomes very large mathematically it works out eight divided by two is four and you can cancel the x squares because they're the same so what we now have is four plus five which is equal to nine so therefore nine is the final answer and that's going to be the horizontal asymptote it's an equation and y equals nine so e is the right answer number eight which the following is equivalent to the limit shown below so go ahead and take a minute and try this problem now we need to know is that the sine function oscillates between one and negative one this is the graph of sine x now the only difference between sine x and sine one over x is how fast it oscillates as you approach an x value of zero it begins to oscillate faster and faster however the amplitude still varies between one and negative one so it really doesn't matter the angle or the fact that we have a one over x within sine because as x approaches zero one over x does not exist as x approaches zero from the left 1 over x becomes negative infinity and as x approaches 0 from the right 1 over x becomes positive infinity but that doesn't matter for the sine function because it's always going to alternate between negative 1 and 1. so we can make this statement sine of one over x will always be between negative one and one now if we multiply everything by x we can get this expression negative x is between sine is between x sine one over x and it's between positive x so x sine 1 over x is between negative x and positive x that's what i meant to say now what we can use is the squeeze term so basically the squeeze term states that let's call this h of x and let's say f of x is between h of x and g of x if the limit as x approaches zero of h of x and g of x if they're the same then the limit as x approaches f of x must also be the same so that's the main idea behind the squeeze term so the limit as x approaches zero for h of x which is really negative x well that's equal to zero now the limit as x approaches zero of g of x which in this case is positive x that two is equal to zero so therefore the limit as x approaches x sine of one over x since it's between negative x and x it too must also equal zero so therefore b is the right answer according to the squeeze term number nine verify that the intermediate value theorem applies to the indicated interval and find the value of c guaranteed by the theorem so based on the intermediate value theorem you need to know that it states that f has to be continuous on the closed interval a to b and that f of a cannot equal f of b and there is some number k which is between f of a and f b such that f c is equal to k and c has to be in the interval of a and b so we got to find that value of c such that k is between f and f b notice that we have the value of k k is whatever number f c is equal to so therefore k is zero so first we've got to show that f of a and f of b well we have to show that zero is between f and f b we have to prove that the ivt term applies so let's find f of a where a is zero and b is two so f of zero is going to be zero squared plus four times zero minus five so f of zero is negative five now let's calculate f of b which is f of two so that's gonna be two squared plus four times two minus five two squared is four four times two is eight four plus eight is twelve minus five that's seven so the intermediate value theorem does apply to the indicated interval as we can see k which is zero is in between negative five and seven so now that we know that the ivt theorem applies we can now find the value of c so let's set f of c equal to zero so basically set the function f of x replace it with zero and find the value of x so zero is equal to x squared plus four x minus five now we need to factor two numbers that multiply to negative five but add to positive four are positive five and negative one therefore we can see that x is equal to negative five and positive one if you reverse the signs if you set x plus five equal to zero x will equal negative five and if you set x minus one equal to zero x will equal positive one now one of these values is the c value that we're looking for so c has to be in the interval a to b that is between zero and two negative five is not between zero and 2 but 1 is so therefore c is equal to 1 which means d is the right answer number 10 find the value of c that will make the function continuous at x equals two the first thing we need to do is set these two functions equal to each other so seven x squared plus c x is equal to two x cubed plus five c plus three now we need to find the value of c when x is two so let's replace x with two and then after that all we have to do is just algebra two squared is four four times seven is twenty-eight two to the third is eight times two is sixteen so now let's subtract both sides by 2c so these will cancel on the left we have 28 and we can combine like terms 16 plus 3 is 19. and 5c minus 2c is 3c now let's subtract both sides by 19. 28 minus 19 is 9. so 9 is equal to 3c so if we divide both sides by 3 we can see that c is nine divided by three which is three and that is the answer so answer choice c is correct ","if I have a function uh F ofx and that function is just equal to a constant C so that's c means constant what I mean by a constant is C could be five C could be 7 C could be -2.4 C could be zero doesn't matter it's a constant it's just a number if this function is just a number then we say that it's derivative FR Prime of X the derivative the slope of this guy really is just equal to zero and if you think about it it makes sense because how would you graph this guy how would you graph this function f ofx is equal to a constant well you draw your little axes and you have a horizontal line that's what that graph looks like if a derivative is really the slope of your function then what is the slope of a horizontal line the slope of any horizontal line is always zero learn anything at math and science.com ","hi there so this time we're going to be doing differentiation rules and we're going to be doing four specifically four of the most important ones that you're going to need to know when uh differentiating the first being the power rule followed by the product rule and the quotient Rule and finally we're going to do the chain rule so let's start with the power rule um and we'll start with the general form of the power rule so here you can see if you were asked to derive something such as x to the n as written there uh its differentiation would simply be n multiplied by x to the N minus one so you bring down that exponent and then subtract one from the actual exponent so I have a few examples lined up here that I'll show you so the first one is if you were asked to find uh like if you asked to differentiate X cubed you'd bring that three down and then go three subtract one which is two so it would be 3x^2 uh the second example is a full polinomial like a three term polinomial 2x^2 + 3x + 4 now if you have to differentiate that you would bring that two down from the exponent and multiply by a two to provide a four and then 2 Min - 1 is 1 so you can just write 4X now for the next part it's 3x raised to the one the one isn't shown but it's there so if you were to bring that down it would just be 3x but it's to the 1 minus one which is zero so the X goes away so then it's just three and four uh just is a constant term so that ends up going to zero you could write plus Z at the end but it's not needed um in example three here you can see uh if you were asked to differentiate root X you can write rewrite it as x to the 1/2 so bring that exponent down so you have2 and then X raised to the2 - 1 is -2 so then you can rewrite that as 1/ 2 times x to the 1/2 because a negative exponent can be brought down to the denominator and then you rewrite that as one 12 or 1/ 2 < tkx next we're going to look at the the product rule and first again we're going to start with a general form and it's basically saying if you're asked to differentiate something that's multiplied by something else so here you can see f ofx * G ofx that equals f ofx * the derivative of G ofx X Plus G ofx time the derivative of F ofx and you can remember this by doing first time derivative of the second plus 2 times derivative of the first so let's look at that example here uh if you're asked to differentiate something like x^2 * 3x you would simply have the first x^2 time derivative of the second plus the 2 3x times derivative of the 1 which is X2 and that can be Rewritten as x^2 * 3 + 3x * 2x because the derivative of 3x is simply 3 and the derivative of x^2 is 2x because you bring down the exponent and subtract one from the exponent so it's 2 to the X No 2 * x to the 2 - 1 which is 1 then you simply multiply those together and add them so you get 9x2 as your derivative uh example two is if you're asked to find the derivative of something like uh X Cub + 3x + 4 and that being multiplied by three now you could simply multiply this in and then just do the uh do the power rule on it but I'm just showing you as a uh visual way to see the product rule itself so again first it's first times derivative of the second plus second times derivative of the first and simply we know that derivative of three is zero so the left hand side of the equation ends up going away because you're multiplying it by a zero and the derivative of x Cub + 3x + 4 is simply 3x^2 + 3 because you drop down the exponent and you use the uh power rule and subtract one from the exponent then uh you simply multiply that three in and you know the derivative of this function is 9x s + 9 so next up is the quotient Rule and here's the general form for for it so if you were asked to differentiate something that was F ofx / G ofx as a general function you would say uh it's G ofx time the derivative of f ofx minus F ofx time derivative of G ofx divided by G of x^ squared now a simple way to remember this is there's a little rhyming scheme that goes uh if you assume G of X is low what we'll call low and F ofx is what we'll call High then you say low D High minus high D low and you say Square the bottom and away we go so basically it's low D High where d means the derivative of the high one so it's low time derivative of high minus High Time derivative of low and you just Square the bottom so it's low D High minus high D low Square the bottom and Away you go so a quick example of this is if you were to have something like x^2 + 2 over 3x + 1 now you would do low which is 3x + 1 * the derivative of high which is x^2 + 2 and then you go minus High x^2 + 2 * derivative of low which is 3x + 1 and you just Square the bottom 3x + 1 all squared so the derivative of x^2 + 2 is simply 2x due to the due to the power rule um and the derivative of 3x + 1 is 3 again due to the power rule then uh you see you have that function there and if you multiply uh this stuff in again there's the same function but if you multiply it in you can see that uh you have some like terms you can subtract off 3x or 6x^2 - 3x^2 and you end up with the function 3x^2 + 2x - 6 over 3x + 1 all SAR so you can um you can expand out that bottom term but there's not really much Point uh it might make it look a little nicer with the quadratic over quadratic but um it's fine leaving it just like that so uh one quick rule with the quotient rule is that you don't actually have to do the quotient rule you can use the uh product rule very simply if you bring up the denominator as something raised to the negative one uh and then just do the do the product rule that way um but moving on we have the chain Rule and uh we're going to start with again the general form of the chain rule so it's if you have a function inside a function so if G ofx were to be a function inside of f ofx um you'd basically do the derivative of the outside leaving the inside in so the derivative of f ofx leaving G ofx exactly how it is and then you multiply it by the derivative of the inside so it's called a chain rule because you have uh some function and then you have to chain on the inside of the function it's derivative so we'll show an example example of that so say if you have x^2 + 3 all raised to the 5 so you do the derivative of just the outside with leaving the inside intact and then you do the derivative of the inside now moving uh on to the next step is so you bring down the five as a power rule the five comes in the front and you drop the exponent down from five to four and then you multiply it by the derivative of the inside where that is simply just 2x because the X squar the two comes down and then you subtract one from the two and uh therefore you just multiply the 2x by the 5 and you have a 10x multiplied x^2 + 3 all raised to the 4 so that's simply the chain rule do the uh derivative of the function leaving the inside perfectly intact and then multiply by the derivative of the inside and this gets uh tricky when you're dealing with trig functions and things like that where you have um other functions in side say a sign or a CO you have to remember to do this always but that's the general form and a single example next up I'm just going to go over the rule overview for you so here we have the power rule overview product rule overview quotient rule overview and the chain rule overview um those are simply all the general forms of each and uh they're very helpful to memorize and if you need the little pneumonic things to uh help you memorize them it helps a lot um product rule first time derivative of the second plus second time derivative of the first quotient rule uh low D High minus high D low square of the bottom and Away you go and chain rule remember you always just if there's a function inside of another you have to uh do the derivative of the inside function also and that's simply Multiplied on um and again the power rule is uh fairly simple just uh drop drop the exponent down and then drop the exponent itself down by a single uh value of one and uh that's all for this tutorial uh I hope it helped and if you have any questions uh feel free to message me and um thanks for watching ","today we're going to talk about related rates and how to solve those problems that you're going to counter in calculus we're going to cover a lot of problems but before we begin let's talk about derivatives now what is the derivative with respect to x of y to the third what would you say the derivative of y cubed using the power rule is three y squared but it's multiplied by d y d x likewise if you differentiate with respect to x let's say r to the fourth it's the derivative of r to the fourth which is four r cubed using the power rule but times d r over dx so let's say if you differentiate with respect to y s to the fifth power this is going to be equal to five s to the fourth times d s divided by d y so notice the pattern so if you differentiate y with respect to x e to get d y d x if you differentiate r with respect to x you'll get d r dx if you differentiate s with respect to y you're going to get d s d y you need to understand what derivative you're going to get after you differentiate a certain variable with respect to another variable now for example if we differentiate x cubed with respect to x is going to be 3x squared times dx over dx which simply disappears and it's just 3x squared now what about the derivative of x cubed with respect to y so for this one it's 3x squared dx dy now for related rate problems you're going to differentiate the equation with respect to time so let's say if you differentiate y to the fifth power with respect to time this is going to be five y to the fourth times d y dt so let's say if you have this equation area is equal to pi r squared and you wish to find the derivative with respect to time the derivative of a is simply 1 but times d a dt the derivative of r squared is 2r but if you differentiate an r with respect to time you're going to get dr dt so now let's work on some problems here's the first one let's say z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared and we have dx dt and dydt find dz dt when x is 8 and y is 15. now whenever you have a problem it's good to make a list of what you have and what you don't have so we have the value of x we know it's 8 and we have the value of y we don't have the value of z but we do have the value of dx dt that's positive 4 and dydt is 5. we're missing is dz dt so before we could find dz dt we need to find z first which we can use this equation to get the answer so since z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared we can plug it in notice that this equation is associated with the pythagorean theorem a squared plus b squared equals c squared for right triangles now there are certain special triangles that you want to be familiar with there's the 3 4 5 triangle there is the 7 24 25 there is the 5 12 13 triangle and also the 8 15 17 triangle notice that we have 8 and 15 the third side is 17. so that tells us that z is 17 but you can always use the equation to get the answer so if you plug it in it's going to be 8 squared plus 15 squared 8 squared that's 64. 15 times 15 is 225 and if you add these two numbers you should get 289 and the square root of 289 is 17. so z is 17. now that we have z what can we do to find dz dt so starting with the same equation let's use implicit differentiation let's differentiate both sides with respect to t so the derivative of z squared is two z times dz dt and the derivative for x squared is 2x times dx dt and for y squared 2y dy dt so if we divide both sides by two we could cancel all the twos so now let's plug in what we have z is 17 we're looking for dz dt x is eight d x dt is four y is fifteen and the y dt is five eight times four is thirty two fifteen times five that's seventy five if you add those two numbers you should get 107. so the zdt is 107 divided by 17. so that's about 6.294 so because dzdt is positive that means that z is increasing with respect to time round two find the rate of change of the distance between the origin and a moving point on the graph y equals x squared plus one so how can we do that so let's draw a rough sketch so we have a graph that looks like this and the point is 2 comma 5 which is probably somewhere over here now we want to find the rate of change of the distance between the origin and the moving point the distance between the origin and the point is represented by this line if we turn it into a triangle we could say that this is x this is y and the distance between the two points let's call it z so therefore we have the equation z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared so we want to find the rate of change of the distance between the origin and the moving point since z is the distance between the origin and the moving point we're looking for dz dt that's what we need to find now let's make a list of the information that we already have we know that x is two and y is five based on the point two comma five we currently don't know the value of z now what about the four centimeters per second what variable does that represent notice that it's associated with the y coordinate and it's a rate so it's d y dt now what about dx dt do we know the value of dx dt we're missing that information too so we got to find it so first let's find z so using this equation we know that x is 2 and y is 5. 2 squared is 4 5 squared is 25 so z squared is 29 which means z is the square root of 29. now we have the equation y is equal to x squared plus one so we can use this equation to find dx dt if we differentiate both sides with respect to time we're going to get d y dt is equal to 2x dx dt dy dt we know it's equal to 4. we have the value and we know x is equal to two so two times two is four so therefore we have four is equal to four times dx dt so if we divide both sides by four dx dt is equal to one now the only thing that we're missing is dz dt that's what we're trying to find once we get that we have the answer to the problem so let's use the original equation or not the original equation but this equation z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared and let's differentiate both sides with respect to time so we did this in the last example so it's um 2z dz dt which equals 2x dx dt plus 2y dy dt so let's get rid of the twos and now we just got to plug in the information that we have so z is square root 29 we're looking for a dz dt x is equal to two dx dt is one y is five and d y dt is four so five times four is 20 plus two that's 22. z prime and dz dt they're the same so dz dt is 22 over root 29 and if you want to rationalize the denominator here's what you could do you can multiply the top and the bottom by root 29 so you can leave your answer as 22 square root 29 divided by 29 so that's dz dt round three the radius of a circle is decreasing at a rate of four centimeters per minute how fast is the area and circumference of the circle changing when the radius is eight so feel free to try these problems and pause the video work it out see if you get the answer and then play the video check your solutions the best way to learn these problems is by working through these problems if you want to do well on your test now how should we begin it helps if you make a list of the information that you know we know the radius is eight now what about the four centimeters per minute what does that represent so that number is associated with the radius and it's a rate so that has to be drdt now notice that drdt is decreasing that means that it's negative if the rdt is negative that means the radius of the circle is getting smaller and smaller now we need to find d80t that's how fast the area is changing and we also need to find dc dt which is how fast the circumference of the circle is changing so you need to know the equations associated with a circle so let's draw a picture so here's a circle and the radius of the circle is the distance between the center and any point on the circle the area of the circle is pi r squared so let's use that to find d a d t if we differentiate both sides with respect to time the derivative of a is one times d a d t pi is a constant so we don't have to worry about that the derivative of r squared is two r times d r d t so r is eight two times a is sixteen d r dt is negative four so d80t is pi times 16 times negative four which is basically negative 64 pi now what are the units for d8t and what are the units for r notice that r is in centimeters and dr dt is centimeters per minute d80t therefore has to be centimeters squared per minute whenever you're dealing with area it's always going to be unit squared if you're dealing with some sort of length or distance it's just like meters centimeters inches feet for volume it's going to be units cubed like cubic centimeters cubic feet and things like that and also you could see it in the equation so we said that d80t is equal to pi times 2r drdc so let's ignore the pi and the two because they're constants r has units centimeters so that's centimeters over one and dr dt has the units centimeters per minute so if you multiply centimeters by centimeters per minute centimeters times centimeters is centimeters squared over minutes and so that's how you can use dimensional analysis to figure out the missing units so now let's find the circumference the circumference of a circle is 2 pi r so let's find the derivative of both sides so it's going to be dc dt 2 pi is a constant the derivative of r is simply 1 times dr dt now as we plug in let's plug in the units as well so dr dt that's going to be negative 4 but centimeters per minute so to find dc dt it's going to be 2 pi times negative 4 which is negative 8 pi and it's going to have the same units as drdt so it's negative 8 pi centimeters per minute as you can see there's no other units to multiply centimeters per minute by so dc dt and drdt that they have the same units so since the radius of the circle is decreasing the circle is getting smaller therefore d80t is negative the area is going to decrease as well and as the area of the circle decreases the circumference is going to decrease as well so that's negative so as you can see the numbers make sense consider this one the surface area of a snowball decreases at a rate of six square feet per hour how fast is the diameter changing when the radius is two so snowball is going to form a shape of a sphere which is basically a three-dimensional circle so here's the radius of the sphere and the diameter is twice the radius the diameter is the line that touches one edge of the circle to the other edge and it passes through the center now we know that the radius is two feet the diameter is twice the value of the radius so it's 4 feet and we're looking for it how fast the diameter is changing so we're looking for d dt now we know how fast the surface area is changing it's decreasing at a rate of six square feet per hour so that's dsa dt since it's decreasing it's negative six so how can we find the rate of change of the diameter with respect to time what equation can we use the surface area of a sphere is four pi r squared now we need to get the surface area in terms of the diameter we said that the diameter is 2r so if we solve for the diameter the radius is d over 2. so we can replace r with d over 2. and it's squared so after we square it it's going to be d squared divided by four two squared is four so notice that we can cancel the force so the surface area is going to be pi times d squared so now let's go ahead and take the derivative of both sides so on the left it's going to be dsa dt pi is a constant the derivative of d squared is two d and it's going to be times d d d t the rate of change of d with respect to time so now we just got to plug in d s a d t is negative six d diameter has a value of four and now we can solve for the missing variable so this is negative six which is equal to eight pi times d dt so if we divide by a pi d d dt is going to be negative 6 over 8 pi which reduces to negative 3 over 4 pi so that is the answer so since the surface area is decreasing the diameter is decreasing therefore dsa dt and dd dt they're both negative now what are the units for ddc diameter is measured in feet because the radius is in feet and time is in hours so it's going to be feet per hour let's try the square problem the side length of a square increases at a rate of three inches per second how fast is the area and perimeter of the square changing when the side length is five so let's draw a picture so we have a square and let's say that the side length is x that means all four sides are x in terms of x what is the equation for the area and the perimeter of a square the area is simply length times width or x times x which is x squared the perimeter is the sum of all four sides so it's x plus x plus x plus x four times which is four x now we know that x is five and we have the rate at which the side length is increasing that means dx dt is positive 5. so now let's find d8t first so if a is equal to x squared d8t is the derivative of x squared which is 2x times dx dt so it's going to be 2 times 5 times dx dt which is i wrote five dxct is supposed to be three i don't know why i wrote five but here it is so it's two times five times three which is thirty now what are the units of d80t now let's go back and let's plug in the units x is 5 but it's 5 inches dx dt is three but it's three inches per second so what happens if you multiply inches times inches per second inches times inches is inches squared seconds times 1 is simply seconds so the final answer for d80t is 30 inches squared per second now let's find dp dt the rate at which the perimeter changes with time so perimeter is 4x so dp dt is going to be 4 times the derivative of x which is 1 times dx dt so dx dt is 3 inches per second multiply that by 4 you should get 12 inches per second and so that's dp dt with the appropriate units since the side length is increasing at 3 inches per second the square is getting bigger which means that the area is going to increase and the perimeter is going to increase so as you can see dp dt is positive and d80t is also positive as the square increases everything is going to increase the side length perimeter and the area so that is it for this problem that's all you got to do to find d a dt and dp dt so here is the spherical balloon problem this balloon is inflated with gas at a rate of 900 cubic centimeters per minute how fast is the radius of the balloon changing when the radius is 12. so let's make a list of the information that we have we have r our goal is to find the rdt and we have the rate of change of the volume when you see cubic centimeters that's a volume and then if you see minutes it tells you it's a rate it's dv over dt so dv dt is it positive or negative since we're inflating the balloon with gas the balloon is going to expand its volume is going to increase so dv dt is positive 900 and r is 12. now the next thing that we need to do once we make a list of all the variables that we have and what we need to find is we need to write an equation what equation relates the volume of a sphere to the radius what equation has volume and radius the volume of a sphere is 4 3 pi r cubed so let's go ahead and find dv dt the derivative of v is simply dv dt 4 over 3 pi is a constant so we can rewrite it the derivative of r to the third is three r squared times d r d t so we can cancel with three and now at this point we just gotta plug in what we have we know that dv dt is 900 then we have 4 pi r is 12 but it's squared and now we could solve for dr dt to isolate drdt let's divide both sides by 4 pi over 12 squared so it's going to be 900 divided by 4 pi 12 squared i'm going to write it as 12 times 12 and all of this is equal to drdc so let's see how we can simplify 900 is 9 times 100 4 we could break that into 2 and 2 and 12 is 4 times 3. so notice that three times three equals nine so we can cancel the nine and the three a hundred is basically four times twenty five so we could cancel one of the fours so at this point there's nothing else that we can cancel so we're going to have a 25 on top on the bottom it's gonna be four times two times two two times two is four times the other 4 that's 16 and then times pi so it's 25 over 16 pi that is equal to dr dt now what are the units for dr dt what is it so here's what you could do analyze the dr and dt part notice that it's radius over time so what is the unit for radius the unit of radius is centimeters as you can see here and a unit of time is minutes so it's simply centimeters per minute so you can look at the variable and you could tell what the units will be the sides of a cube are increasing at a rate of 5 centimeters per second how fast is the surface area and volume increasing when the side length is 10 centimeters so let's draw a picture so let's draw a cube so let's say that the edge of each cube has a side length of x what is the equation for the volume of the cube and the surface area if you have a three-dimensional rectangular prism or a cube the volume is going to be length times width times height or simply x cubed what about the surface area the area of each face is basically the length times the width which is x times x or x squared now the six faces of a cube so the surface area is six x squared now that we have the equations that we need let's make a list of all the variables that we have so we know that x is equal to 10 and dx dt is 5 centimeters per second that's how fast the edges of the cube are increasing so now let's go ahead and find how fast the surface area is increasing so starting with this equation the derivative is going to be dsa over dt which is equal to 6 times 2x times dx dt so x is 5 and dx dt x is not 5 x is 10. i'm looking at this number dx t is five so what is two times ten two times ten is twenty twenty times five is a hundred and 100 times 6 is 600. now what are the units for dsa dt so sa is surface area the units for area is always unit squared so it's going to be centimeters squared now we have time on the bottom the unit for time in this problem is seconds so it's centimeters squared per second now let's see how fast the volume is changing so volume is x cubed that means dv dt is the derivative of x cubed which is 3x squared times dx dt so x is this number which is 10 and dx dt is five ten squared ten times ten is a hundred a hundred times five is five hundred and five hundred times three is 1500 since 5 times 3 is 15. so dv dt is 1500 now we need to find the units the unit for volume is unit cube if the side length is centimeters then for volume it's going to be cubic centimeters and we know dt is measured in seconds so it's cubic centimeters per second and it's positive since the volume is increasing if x is increasing the surface area and the volume will increase next up the ladder problem a 13 foot ladder is leaning against a house let's use a building let's say this is the building here's the ground and here is the ladder so it forms the right triangle now let's define what the letters are let's say this is x y and let's say l is the length of the ladder instead of z now the ladder slides down the wall at a rate of three feet per minute so what does that mean what variable does that correspond to well we know it's a rate so it's something with dt now it slides down the wall going down the wall that's associated with y so that tells you how fast y is changing with respect to time so we could say that d y d t is three feet per minute now is it positive or is it negative so as the ladder slides down the wall is y increasing or decreasing because y is decreasing d y dt is negative three now how fast is the ladder moving away from the base of the wall when the foot of the wall i mean when the foot of the ladder is currently five feet from the wall so if you want to find out how fast is moving away from the wall we're looking for dx dt so as the ladder slides down the wall x will increase so dx dt has to be positive and that's what we're looking for at least for the first part of the problem there's multiple parts now we know that the length of the ladder is 13 and we know it's currently 5 feet from the wall that means x is 5. so we're missing y and also dl dt so let's find y first notice that this is the 5 12 13 triangle remember your special right triangles but using the equation you can get the same answer l squared is x squared plus y squared so l is thirteen x is five let's solve for y thirteen squared is one sixty-nine five times five is twenty-five one sixty-nine minus twenty-five is one forty-four and the square root of one forty-four is 12. so we get the same answer so now let's find dx dt let's take the derivative of both sides so what is the derivative of l squared is it 2l dl dt the answer is it's not it's zero the length of the ladder is not changing the ladder won't increase or decrease in size it's going to stay a constant 13 feet and the derivative of a constant is zero even if you were to differentiate l squared let's say if you got two l dl dt because the left of the ladder is not changing that means dl dt is zero it doesn't change with respect to time so the whole thing on the left side is still going to be zero now we know that the derivative of x squared is 2x dx dt and y squared is 2y dydt x and y are variables that are changing and so dx dt and dydt is not equal to 0. if we divide both sides by 2 we can get rid of the coefficients so negative x dx dt is equal to y d y dt so x is five we're looking for dx dt y is equal to 12 and dy dt that's negative three 12 times negative 3 is negative 36 and if we divide it by negative 5 we're going to get negative 36 over negative 35 the two negative signs will cancel so it's simply 36 over 5. notice that dx dt is positive as the ladder slides down y decreases so dy dt is negative but as it slides down it moves to the right which means that x is increasing so that's why dx dt is positive now what is 36 over 5 as a decimal this is the same as 35 over five plus one over five five goes into 35 seven times and one fifth is 0.2 so dx dt is 7.2 now what are the units of dx t so first what are the units for dx if you notice everything is in feet so dx has unit fee and for dt time is in minutes so it's going to be 7.2 feet per minute that's how fast x is increasing towards the right now what about the area of the triangle the second part of the question how fast is the area of the triangle changing so first let's write an equation for the area of the triangle the area of a triangle is one half base times height in this case the base is x the height of the triangle's y so to find d a d t we need to use the product rule so let's say if f is equal to one half x and g is y the equation for the product rule the derivative of f g is going to be f prime g plus f g prime so basically you find the derivative of the first part that's f prime you keep the second part the same that's simply g plus you keep the first part the same that's f times the derivative of the second part g prime so what is the derivative of f the first part the derivative of one half x is simply one half but with respect to time we need to add dx dt the second part y is going to stay the same plus the first part is going to stay the same that's one half x times the derivative of the second part the derivative of y is one times d y dt so now let's plug in what we have to find d adt so dx dt which we got in the last problem we said it was 7.2 or 36 over 5. let's leave it as 36 over 5 for now so it's one half times 36 over 5 times y which is 12 plus one half times x which is five times d y dt which is negative three all of that is equivalent to d8t so now let's simplify what we have half of 36 is 18 and 18 times 12 that's 216 divided by 5 that's 43.2 5 times negative 3 is negative 15 divided by 2 that's negative 7.5 so 43.2 minus 7.5 should give you a final answer of 35.7 for d80t so now what are the units for d80c the units for da which is area it's unit squared and the unit for lamp for distance in this problem is feet so d a is going to be square feet dt has unit minutes so it's going to be square feet per minute so now let's move on to the third part of the problem how can we find how fast the angle between the ladder and the ground how fast it's changing so here's the ground here's the ladder the angle between them is this angle theta so what equation can we use to relate theta now there's many equations that we could use we could use sine cosine or tangent so perhaps you're familiar with sohcahtoa the sole part means that sine is opposite divided by hypotenuse cah stands for cosine is adjacent divided by hypotenuse and tangent is opposite of adjacent so if we wish to use sine sine theta is going to be equal to the side that's opposite to it which is y divided by the hypotenuse the hypotenuse is the side across the box so that's the length of the ladder in this case it's l if we want to use cosine it's adjacent over hypotenuse adjacent to the angle is x so this is going to be x over l and if we wish to use tangent tangent is opposite divided by adjacent so it's y divided by x now you can get the right answer using each one but you want to pick one that's easy to work with for example if you use tangent this is y over x to find the derivative you're going to have to use a quotient rule and that's going to be a lot of work so personally i would avoid using tangent in this particular case the reason why you want to use sine or cosine is because l is a constant and so it's gonna be very easy to find the derivative for example the derivative of five x is simply five so if you wanna differentiate x over l this is one over l times x 1 over l is a constant just like 5 is a constant so the derivative of 1 over l times x is simply 1 over l so it's easier if we use sine or cosine i'm going to choose cosine actually let's use sine let's begin so the derivative of sine is cosine theta and we need to differentiate the inside the angle of cosine the derivative of theta is d theta dt now y over l is the same as 1 over l times y the derivative of a constant times y is the constant times one but times dy dt so as you can see it's much easier to find how fast the angle is changing using sine or cosine avoid the quotient rule if possible it'll make your life a lot easier now we don't know what cosine theta is equal to our goal is to find d theta dt so right now we can't finish this problem we got to find theta somehow now we can use sine cosine or tangent to find theta it doesn't matter which one let's use sine sine theta we said is equal to y divided by l so if you take the inverse sine of both sides theta is the inverse sine of y over l and y is 12 l is 13. so if you type that into the calculator make sure you calculate is in degree mode inverse sine 12 over 13 you should get 67.4 degrees or 67.38 so now we could plug that in into cosine or better yet if you plug in cosine 67.38 you're going to get .38 but you don't need the calculator to get cosine theta you can use sohcahtoa cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse it's 5 over 13 x is 5 l is 13. so when you type in cosine 67.38 and when you get 0.3846 if you type in 5 over 13 it's the same answer 0.3846 so 5 over 13 is a more accurate answer so let's replace cosine theta with 5 over 13 and let's solve for d theta dt so l is 13 and now we need to look for d dt so if we multiply both sides by 13 we could cancel these two so what we now have is five times d theta dt is equal to d y dt so d theta dt is d y dt divided by five and d y dt is negative three so it's negative three over five which is negative point six now what are the units for d theta dt how can we figure that out the angle theta the standard angle is radians and time is minutes so it should be radians per minute gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of 100 cubic feet per minute forming a conical pile whose base diameter is two times the altitude how fast is the height changing when the pile is 12 feet high so how can we do this so let's draw a picture so we're going to have the shape of a cone and here we have a conveyor belt and gravel is being poured onto this conical pile so the pile is going to increase in value now how can we find how fast the height is changing how can we figure that out so what do we know the 100 cubic feet per minute what does that represent that's dv dt that's how fast the volume is changing remember cubic feet is always associated with volume we know that the height is currently 12 and our goal is to find dhdt now what equation do we need to solve this particular problem so we need an equation that relates to volume to height and the volume of a cone is one third pi or square times height now we don't need the radius in this problem because we don't know what it is nor do we know what dr dt is so in that case somehow we need to get rid of r and replace it with h so this is the radius of the conical pile and this represents the height now we need to focus on this sentence the diameter is 2 times the altitude so d equals 2h now remember diameter is twice the value of the radius so d equals 2r so if we divide both sides by 2 we can see that the radius is equivalent to the height so therefore we can replace r with h for this particular problem so h squared times h is h to the third power so now we could differentiate both sides with respect to t so dv dt is going to be the constant one-third times pi and then times the derivative of h to the third which is degree h squared times d h dt so now we can solve for dhdt so dv dt that's 100 and then h we know it's 12. so we have 1 pi 1 3 pi times 3 times 12 squared times dh dt so the threes cancel so we have 100 is equal to pi times 12 squared times dh dt so if we divide by 144 pi it's a hundred over this number and we can reduce it if we divide both numbers by two it's going to be 50 over 72 pi and if we divided by two again it's 25 over 36 pi so this is the answer this is the value of dh dt now the units for dhdt dh which is represented with the height it's feet and dt is the unit times so that's minutes so it's going to be feet per minute now let's say that we have an inverted conical tank and water is leaking out now it's leaking out at a rate of 500 cubic centimeters per minute so go ahead and pause the video and see if you can work out this problem the height of the tank is 24 centimeters and the radius is 6 centimeters now the water level is currently nine centimeters high so let's say it's somewhere in this region how can we find the rate at which water is being poured into the tank so we want to find dv dt but we have a dvdt value ready so be careful with this problem since the water level is rising the rate of water that enters into the tank exceeds the rate of water that leaves the tank now let's go ahead and get volume in terms of height again just like we did in the last problem so we're going to use the volume of a cone which is 1 3 pi r squared times the height now we need to replace r with h we don't know what d r dt is but we do know what dht is we have the rate at which the water level is rising that's dht if we were given dr dt then it would be better to replace h with r and get the volume in terms of r only but since we don't have drdt we have the htt we want it in terms of h so how can we write an equation that relates the height and the radius together notice that the height is 24 centimeters that's for the tank and the radius of the tank is six centimeters so the ratio between height and radius is four to one now the water is going to form the shape of the tank a liquid always has the shape of its container so for the water level the ratio between height and the radius is still going to be the same it's going to be four to one so we can write this equation we can say that h is four times the radius 24 is 4 times 6. if you plug in 6 for the radius you'll get a height of 24. but now we need to get r in terms of h so we need to solve for so h divided by 4 is equal to the radius so let's replace r with h divided by 4. so we're going to have h squared divided by 16. and then we can multiply 3 and 16. so the equation is going to be 1 over 48 times pi times h cubed so now let's take the derivative of both sides with respect to time so therefore dv dt is equal to 1 over 48 times pi times 3h squared times dhdt now we need to understand what dv dt represents dv dt represents the net rate of the volume of water that enters into the conical pile so let's say let's make up some numbers let's say if 800 cubic centimeters of water is flowing per minute into the uh the tank and at the same time a hundred cubic centimeters per minute of water is leaking out of the tank then the volume is increasing at a rate of 700 per cubic centimeters per minute so in one minute if you add 800 cubic centimeters of water and within that same minute 100 leaks out the tank it gains a net of 700 cubic centimeters of water dvdt represents the 700 it represents the net change of water that flows into it or then that rate i should say so we could say that dv dt represents the rate of volume that flows into the tank minus the rate of volume that flows out of the tank now we don't have dv dt yet so we got to find it so let's use this equation to get the answer so dv dt is equal to 1 over 48 times pi times 3 times the height squared and the height is 6 centimeters i mean not 6 but 9. and dhdt is positive 15. so we can cancel with three and this would be 16. so what we have is pi times nine squared times fifteen divided by sixteen nine squared is eighty one times fifteen that's twelve fifteen over sixteen which we can't reduce it but let's turn it to a decimal so dv dt is 238 0.56 now this includes the pi so now that we have that we can use this equation so let's replace dv dt with this number and the volume that goes into it is what we're looking for and the rate of change of the volume that flows out is 500 so we need to add 500 to both sides so the rate of water that flows into the tank is 738.56 cubic centimeters per minute now let's understand what's going on here so water is being poured into the tank at a rate of 738.56 cubic centimeters per minute and 500 cubic centimeters per minute of water flows out of the tank so the tank gains a net of 238.56 cubic centimeters of water every minute so the water level is still rising but that's the net gain which represents dvdt in the equation but our final answer which is the rate of water that's being poured into the tank is 735 i mean 738.56 you need to add these two values to get it a street light is mounted on a pole 24 feet tall a man six feet tall walks away from the pole at a rate of four feet per second how fast is the tip of his shadow moving when he is 20 feet from the pole and also how fast is the length of his shadow changing at this instant so we need to draw a picture let's say this is the pole and here's the man he's six feet tall now the light is gonna shine on him creating a shadow so here's the shadow so over here we have 24 and six let's call this distance x and let's say this is s so s is the length of the shadow and x is the distance between the man and the pole and let's say l is the distance between the pole and the tip of the shadow using this information how can you figure out the answer to the two questions now here's what you need to know for this question if you want to find the rate at which the tip of the shadow is moving you need to look for a dldt now if you want to find how fast the length of his shadow is changing you're looking for ds dt as long as you understand that then you can easily solve these problems so let's begin now what we have is two similar triangles if we draw the larger triangle this is 24 and on the bottom we have x plus s now for the smaller triangle it's 6 and s so we can make a ratio we could set up a proportion between these two triangles and if you're not sure about how to set up the proportion notice that these two they have the same angle theta so tangent theta for this triangle is going to be opposite over adjacent which is 24 over x plus s now tangent theta for this angle is going to be 6 over s 6 is opposite and the s is adjacent to it so therefore since tangent theta equals tangent theta 24 over x plus s equals six over s now that we set up the proportion let's cross multiply 24 times s is 24s 6 times x plus 6 if we distribute it's going to be 6x plus 6s now let's subtract 6s from both sides so 24 minus 6 is 18. so 18s is equal to 6x now let's get s in terms of x if we divide both sides by eighteen s is six over eighteen which is one third times x so we don't need this equation anymore now from this equation we can find how fast the tip of the shadow is moving and also the length of the shadow but i think it's easier if we answer the second part of the question because the rate at which the length of the shadow is changing is dt so if we take the derivative of both sides ds dt is equal to 1 3 dx dt so dx dt that is equal to let's see four feet per second that's how fast the man is walking away from the 24 foot pole he's moving at a speed of four feet per second so x is increasing four feet every second so that's dx dt so in this problem ds dt is 4 over 3 feet per second now that we have the answer to the second part of the question let's find the answer to the first part so the rate at which the tip of the shadow is moving is dl dt and l is basically x plus s now we can get l in terms of x because we have the value of s s is one third x so x plus one third x is equal to l one plus a third is basically three over three plus one over three so that's uh four over three so l is four over three x so using this we can find dl dt dl dt is going to be 4 over 3 dx dt and dx dt we know it's 4 feet per second so 4 times 4 is 16 so the answer is 16 over 3 feet per second so when you see these questions if you want to find the length or the rate at which the tip of the shadow is moving just make sure that you know that you're looking for dlvt if you want to find out how fast the length of the shadow is moving find dfct if you understand that then these problems won't be that bad try this one a spotlight on the ground shines on a wall 18 meters so let's say this is the ground level and let's say this is the wall and here's the spotlight and there's a man who's two meters tall and he's walking towards the building so he's moving in this direction at a speed of two meters per second now we know the spotlight is 18 meters from the wall and the man is two meters tall so the light is going to shine on his head and it's going to hit the wall so his shadow is on the wall so s represents the length of the shadow and he is currently eight meters from the building how fast is the length of his shadow on the building changing when he's eight meters from the building so we're looking for dsct what can we do to find dsdt so we need to set up an equation and we need to use similar triangles to do it just like we did in the last example so looking at the large triangle we know this is s and 18 is not going to change so the distance between the spotlight and the building is going to remain 18. the spotlight is not moving and the building is not moving however the man is moving now let's say that the distance between the man and the spotlight is y and the distance between the man and the wall or the building let's say it's x so 18 equals x plus y but now let's draw the smaller triangle which is this one for the smaller triangle this is two and this is y now y is changing as the person moves to the right x is decreasing so dx dt is negative but y is increasing so d dt is positive now what about the shadow on the building as the person moves to the right is the length of the shadow increasing or decreasing so let's say if we draw the person here let's make sure that he has the same height notice that the length of the shadow decreased it's now a little bit shorter so as he walks towards the building the shadow is going to decrease so dst should be negative for our final answer now let's set up the proportion if you ever have difficulty setting up the proportion use the technique that we use in the last example find the common angle the common angle of both triangles is the angle between the spotlight and the ground we'll call that theta which is right here tangent theta for the triangle on top is going to be opposite over adjacent which is s over 18. and tangent theta for the other triangle is opposite divided by adjacent that's 2 over y therefore s over 18 is equal to 2 over y so now let's cross multiply if we cross multiply it's going to be 18 times 2 which is 36 and that's equal to s times y now we don't know what d y dt is but we do have the value of deoxyt dx dt is the speed at which the person is moving to the right actually now that i think about it it turns out that we do have dydt so i take it back the ydt and the axis here the same one is positive and the other is negative the reason why is because the length between the spotlight and the building is constant 18. so for example here's y here's x currently x is eight that means y has to be ten if the total length is eighteen now the person is moving at two meters per second so in one second x is going to increase by 2 meters it's going to be 10 and y is going to decrease by 2 meters is going to be 8 because the total has to be 18. so we could say that well actually no i did that wrong x should be decreasing as the person moves to the right x is going to be smaller because he's going to be closer to the building so it's going to decrease by two in one second and in one second y is going to increase by 2 meters so it's going to be 12. 12 plus 6 is still 18. so dx dt is negative 2 meters per second and dy dt should be positive 12 meters per second so let's calculate ds dt using x and y separately let's see if we get the same answer so let's find the derivative of both sides the derivative of 36 is zero to differentiate s y we need to use the product rule so if we differentiate the first part we're going to get ds dt times the second part which is going to stay the same plus the first part which is going to say the same times the derivative of the second which is dy dt so ds dt we're looking for that we don't know what that is currently y is 10 when x is 8. so if x is 8 this has to be 10 because x and y has to add up to 18. now we need to find the value of s so we can use this equation to do so so 36 is equal to s times y so when y is 10 s has to be 3.6 starting with this equation if we solve for s s is equal to 36 divided by y and since y is 10 36 divided by 10 is 3.6 so now we could find dsct if we plug in dydt so we said that dx dt is negative 2 because x is decreasing so and dydt is positive 2 because y is increasing at the same rate so 3.6 times 2 is 7.2 and let's move that to the other side so we have negative 7.2 is equal to 10 times ds dt so if we divide both sides by 10 ds dt is equal to negative 0.72 and it's going to be meters per second so now let's find ds dt another one so starting with the same equation 36 is equal to sy but instead of using a product rule let's use let's do something different let's solve for s now we need to write y in terms of x we know that x plus y adds up to 18. so if you solve for y y is 18 minus x so therefore we have this equation s is 36 over 18 minus x and we can rewrite it we can move the 18 minus x to the top so this is equal to 36 18 minus x raised to the minus one so now we can use the power rule to find dlct using the power rule we need to move the negative one to the front ds dt is going to be equal to negative 36 next we need to keep the inside the same 18 minus x then subtract the exponent by one so this is going to be negative two times the derivative of the inside which is negative one so to rewrite it ds dt or simply s prime is going to be negative 36 times negative one so that's positive 36 and since the exponent is negative we're going to move it to the bottom to make it positive so it's going to be 18 minus x on the bottom squared and there's one thing we're missing anytime you differentiate x we need to add dx dt so let's add it here so it's 36 divided by 18 minus x x is eight so 18 minus eight that's 10 and then it's squared and dx dt this is going to be negative 2 because x is decreasing so let's type it in times negative 2 that's negative 72 divided by 10 squared 10 squared is 100 so negative 72 divided by 100 gives you the same answer which is negative 0.72 so you could find the sdt used in x or y so in this problem you just need to realize that dx dt is negative 2 because x is decreasing but dy dt is positive 2 because increasing but they're changing at the same rate because the total distance has to be 18 the rate at which x decreases is equal to the rate at which y decreases let's try this one this problem shouldn't be too bad two cars are moving starting at the same point one travels north at 30 miles per hour and the other travels east at 40 miles per hour at what rate is the distance between the two cars changing three hours later so how can we find the answer to this question so let's say that they start at this point so one car is traveling north and the other one is traveling east the distance between the two cars is the hypotenuse of the triangle so let's say this is x this is y and it's a z so the car that's traveling north is going at 30 miles per hour so that's the rate that's dy dt dy dt is 30 and it's positive 30 because y is increasing dx dt is 40. that's the car that's traveling east our goal is to find dz dt now we need to find the values of x y and z so x is the distance that the car travels as it goes towards the east and y is the distance that the first car travels heading north so let's start with x how can we find x y and z using a speed notice that we have the time let's start with x first if the car is traveling east at 30 miles per hour what distance will it travel in three hours now what is the speed of 30 miles per hour mean in one hour what is the distance that the car will travel if the car is moving at 30 miles per hour in one hour it's going to travel 30 miles in two hours it's going to travel 60 miles in 3 hours 90. another way you can find the answer is using this equation d equals rt distance is equal to rate times time the rate is in this case 30 miles per hour so if you multiply it by 3 hours notice that the unit hours cancel and so you get 90 miles so x is 90. now what about y so if the car is moving 40 miles per hour in one hour it's going to travel 40 miles 2 hours 80 miles 3 hours 120 miles so all you got to do is 40 multiply by 3 and that's going to give you 120. now what is the value of z to find z you can use the pythagorean theorem x squared plus y squared equals z squared or a squared plus b squared equals c squared so what is 90 squared plus 120 squared and then the square root of that what is that equal to notice that this is associated with the 345 triangle or you could say the 30 40 50 triangle if you multiply 30 by 3 you'll get 90. if you multiply 40 by 3 you'll get 120 so 50 times 3 is 150 that tells us that z is 150 using the 3 4 5 ratio but you can always use the calculator so let's go ahead and do that ninety squared is eighty one hundred and one twenty squared is fourteen thousand four hundred when you add them you should get twenty two thousand five hundred if you take the square root of that you do indeed get 150. so z is 150. now that we have z we could find dz dt so let's take the derivative of both sides the derivative of x squared is 2x dx dt for y squared it's 2y d y dt and for z squared it's 2z dz dt so if we divide both sides by two we can get rid of all the twos and now let's plug in what we have so x is 90 times dx dt which is 40 plus y which is 120 times dy dt and that's 30 and that's equal to z which is 150 times dz dt which is the answer that we're looking for so let's get rid of this and let's solve it so what's ninety times forty nine times four is thirty six so we just gotta add the two zeros twelve times three is thirty six so let's add two zeros and this is equal to 150 times dz dt so we have 7200 divided by 150 so we can cancel a zero so that's 720 over 15. and let's use the calculator at this point 720 divided by 15 is 48 so dz dt is equal to 48. let's try this one at one o'clock ship b is 150 miles east of ship a ship a is moving 30 miles per hour north and ship b is moving 20 miles per hour south how fast is the distance between the ships changing at 3 o'clock so notice the time difference between 1 o'clock and three o'clock so it's two hours later now what can we do the first thing you should do is draw a picture so b is east of a that means a is on the west side and b is on the east side now the distance between them is 150 miles that's the horizontal distance b is moving south at 20 miles per hour and a is moving north at 30 miles per hour so every hour ship a moves 30 miles so in two hours it's going to move 60 miles ship b moves 20 miles every hour so in two hours it's going to move 40 miles so let's draw a picture representing their current position so the horizontal distance between them is still 150. now what i'm going to do is take this portion and add it to this side so a is going to be a hundred miles north of b at this point b is over here so we added 60 and 40. notice that the horizontal distance between a and b is going to be the same that's not going to change because a is moving north b is moving south the vertical distance will change if a moves 60 miles north and if b moves 40 miles south vertically speaking there are 100 miles apart along the y axis so it helps if you redraw the picture like this so now let's put some letters in this picture let's say the horizontal distance between a and b is l so l doesn't change l is constant now let's say the distance that b moves is x and the distance that a moves is y so this side the vertical distance is going to be x plus y and let's say z is the distance between a and b so you want to redraw the picture so that it forms a triangle the key is to add y and x because the vertical distance between a and b two hours later is the sum of x and y it's 40 plus 60. if a moves 60 miles north and b moves 40 miles south they're currently 100 miles away from each other once you understand that now you can finish the problem so using the pythagorean theorem we have the equation a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared let's say a is l so we have l squared b is going to be x plus y so it's x plus y squared and c is the hypotenuse which is z squared so let's make some space so we know x x is 40 y is 60. we don't know the value of z but we do know dx dt which i'm going to write it as x prime that is 20 miles per hour y prime or dy dt that's 30 miles per hour our goal is to find dz dt and of course let us not forget l which is 150 so now let's find z first let's plug in the numbers into this equation so l squared is 150 squared plus x which is 40 plus y which is 60 squared and that is equal to z squared 40 plus 60 is 100 and 100 squared is 10 000. if we add that to 150 squared you should get 32 500 then if you take the square root of both sides you'll see that z is if you want the exact answer is 50 radical 13 which as a decimal that's 180.28 so now that we have the value of z we can now find the derivative the derivative of l squared which is a constant that's going to be zero now the derivative of x plus y squared we need to use the chain rule so let's move the exponent to the front so it's going to be 2 keep the inside the same x plus y then subtract it by one so now the exponent is one times the derivative of the inside the derivative of x is dx dt which is x prime and for y it's y prime and that is equal to the derivative of z squared which is two z dz dt or z prime now let's divide both sides by two and now let's plug in x plus y that's 40 plus 60 and then x prime plus y prime we know dx dt is 20 gy dt is 30 and z which is a hundred eighty point two eight times the z prime forty plus sixty is a hundred twenty plus thirty is fifty and we need to divide this by one eighty point two eight so 100 times 50 is 5000 divided by 180.28 so dz dt is 27.73 so that's the final answer to this problem that is the value of dz dt that's how fast the distance between the two ships is changing at 3 pm or 2 hours later let's work on this one an airplane at an altitude of 3 miles travels horizontally at 400 miles per hour it passes directly over a radar station what is the rate at which the distance between the plane and the radar station is changing when the plane is six miles away from the station so let's say here's the station represented by this box it's at ground level and there's a plane that's flying at this point now we know that the plane is three miles above the radar station and we want to find a distance when it's six miles away from the station so it's going to travel some distance horizontally and the hypotenuse of the triangle form that's going to be the six miles so after travels some distance horizontally it's going to be six miles away from the radar station so let's say z is the hypotenuse y is three and we need to find x so we have the equation z squared is equal to x squared plus y squared z is six y is three so what is the value of x six squared is 36 three squared is nine thirty-six minus nine is twenty-seven so x is the square root of twenty-seven twenty-seven is nine times three and the square root of nine is three so x is three root three now that we have the value of x how can we find dz dt now what does the 400 miles per hour represent the 400 miles per hour is dx dt because the plane is moving horizontally in the direction of x so starting with this equation x squared plus y squared equals c squared we could find the derivative of both sides 2x times dx dt will say just x prime plus 2y times y prime actually i take that back y is a constant because the plane is traveling horizontally the altitude will always be three so the derivative of y squared is simply zero and then it's going to be 2z times z prime so we could divide both sides by 2. we know that x is 3 root 3 and x prime is dx t which is 400 z is 6 so now we can solve for z prime so it's 3 root 3 times 400 divided by 6. 400 is 2 times 200 and 6 is 3 times 2 so we can cancel a 3 and we can cancel a 2. so z prime or dz dt the rate at which the plane and the distance with the radar station is changing that's going to be 200 times radical three which as a decimal that's 346 so that's how fast the distance between a plane and a radar station is changing when the plane is six miles away an airplane travels horizontally at 600 miles per hour at an altitude of three miles toward an observer that is currently 10 miles away how fast is the angle between the ground and the observer's line of sight to the airplane changing at this instant so let's say if this is the ground level and here we have the observer and let's say this is the airplane and here is the observer's line of sight so let's turn into a triangle now the airplane is currently 10 miles from the observer and is traveling at an altitude of three miles and we have the speed of the airplane so let's call this x this is going to be y and let's say this is z our goal is to find out how fast is the angle between the ground and the observer's line of sight is changing so we need to find d theta dt now we have dxct that's how fast the plane is moving because the plane is moving towards the observer x is decreasing therefore dx dt is negative 600. now which trig function should we use we need to write an equation with theta if we use cosine cosine theta is going to be x divided by z sine theta is y divided by z and tangent theta is y divided by x which one is the best one to use we don't want to use cosine because x and z are both variables we want to use y because y is a constant it's easier to deal with a constant for this one we would have to use the quotient rule if we have to uh differentiate it now we don't want to use sine theta either because even though y is a constant we don't have the value for dz dt so we don't want to use that tangent is the best one to use in this case the derivative of tangent is secant squared and the derivative of theta is d theta dt now we want to differentiate y divided by x so y is a constant so it's really y times one over x and for one over x we need to rewrite it as x minus one the derivative of x to the negative one is negative one x to minus two which if you rewrite it it's gonna be negative y over x squared and let's not forget dx dt so this is the equation that we have the only thing we're missing is the value of x and the value of secant theta so let's find x first so using the equation x squared plus y squared equals z squared it's x squared plus three squared equals ten squared ten squared is a hundred three squared is nine a hundred minus nine is 81 i mean not 81 but 91 so x squared is 91 which we can replace x squared directly with 91 in this case we don't have to take the square root of x squared now let's find out what cosine theta is equal to so x is root 91 for the triangle cosine theta is adjacent divided by the hypotenuse so it's going to be the square root of 91 divided by 10. now secant is the reciprocal of cosine secant theta is 1 divided by cosine so if cosine theta is root 91 over 10 secant theta is ten divided by root ninety one so now we can plug in everything that we have so if secant theta is 10 divided by root 91 secant squared is going to be 10 squared which is 100 divided by root 91 squared which is simply 91 and then this is times d theta dt and this is equal to negative y which is negative 3 divided by x squared x squared is going to be 91 times dx dt which is negative 600. so now we can solve for d theta dt so if we multiply both sides by 91 we could cancel these terms so we have a hundred times d theta dt and that's equal to negative three times negative six hundred so if we divide both sides by a hundred we're going to get the value of d theta negative 600 divided by 100 is negative 6. we could cancel the two zeros so d theta dt is going to be negative 3 times negative 6 which is 18 and so it's going to be 18 radians per hour notice that the time is in hours since the speed is 600 miles per hour so dt has to be associated with hours and the angle is typically associated with radians a baseball diamond is a square with side 100 feet so let's draw a picture a batter hits the ball and runs towards first base so this is the home plate here's first base second base third base and he's heading towards first base with a speed of 20 feet per second at what rate is his distance from second base changing when he is 30 feet from first base so we know the side length is 100 feet so he's somewhere at this point right now so if he's 30 feet from first base that means that he's 70 feet from the home plate so now if we were to draw a triangle we want to find the rate at which his distance from second base is changing when he's 30 feet from first base so this is the triangle that we want to draw and because it's a square this triangle is a right triangle so let's say that this distance is x this is y and this is z so we know that x is thirty y is a hundred and we gotta find z using the equation x squared plus y squared equals z squared we have 30 squared plus 100 squared is equal to z squared a hundred squared is ten thousand and thirty squared is only nine hundred so the square root of that result is going to be a hundred and four 0.4 so now that we have z we could find dz dt so starting with this equation let's go ahead and use implicit differentiation let's differentiate both sides with respect to time the derivative of x squared is 2x times dx dt which we can write as x prime now y is a constant as the runner as the batter runs towards the first base y is not going to change it's going to remain a hundred the derivative of a constant is zero and the derivative of z squared is 2z z prime so we can divide both sides by 2 and now we just got to plug in so x is 30 dx dt is it positive 20 or negative 20. now notice that x is decreasing as he runs towards first base x is going to get smaller and smaller so dx dt or x prime is negative 20 since x is decreasing z is 104.4 so z prime is going to be 30 times negative 20 divided by 104.4 so z prime which is dz dt is negative 5.75 and a unit is going to be feet per second now what about the second part how fast is his distance changing from the home plate if he's halfway from the first base running towards the second base what would you do to answer that so let's redraw this diagram so he's currently halfway from first base and he's traveling this way so he's between first base and second base and we want to find out how fast the distance is changing from where he is and home plate which is over here so if we draw a line this is the new z value and this is the hypotenuse of the right triangle so let's say that this is x and this is y so y is going to remain a hundred x is no longer 30. if he's halfway between the first base and second base that means x is 50 which is half of 100 and z is going to be different so we have to recalculate z so let's go ahead and do that so x squared plus y squared is equal to our z squared x is 50 y is a hundred we know that 100 squared is ten thousand fifty squared is twenty five hundred so when you add them you get twelve thousand five hundred if you take the square root it's going to be fifty root five which is one eleven point so now that we have the value of z we could find dz dt which is what we're looking for that's how fast the distance between the home plate and where he is is changing now we're going to assume that the speed is still 20 feet per second let's assume that his speed is constant i didn't mention it for the second problem but it's understood that it's going to be the same at least it should be the same if it's not specified that the speed is different so we're going to have 2x times x prime y is a constant so the derivative of y squared is still zero and then two z z prime so just like before we're going to divide by two x is fifty now x prime is it positive twenty or negative twenty notice that the way we drew it x is increasing as he moves towards a second base this part of the triangle is going to get bigger so instead of plugging negative 20 we need to plug in positive 20. z is equal to 111.8 so let's solve for z prime so it's going to be 50 times 20 which is a thousand divided by 11.8 so dz dt is 8.945 feet per second so for this problem we have a trough that contains isosceles triangles so let's draw it so here is the length of the trough it's 12 feet and it's four feet wide and it has a height of two feet now it's filled with water and the water level is currently one feet high how fast is the water level changing when the water is one feet deep how can we figure this out so our goal is to find dhdt so the height of the water is currently one feet and what is the equation for the volume of this trough the volume of the trough is one half the length times the width times the height the length of the trough will always be 12 feet no matter how deep the water is so l is constant so it's one half times 12 times wh now notice that the width is twice the value of the height so we could say that w is equal to 2h so we can replace w with 2h so now we have the volume in terms of h and we can cancel the two with the one half so v is equal to 12 h squared so now if we take the derivative of both sides we'll see that dv dt is equal to 12 times 2h times dh dt now we have the value of dv dt the water is being poured into the trough at 36 cubic feet per minute so the volume is increasing so it's positive 36 and the height is currently one so now we could solve for dhdt if we divide both sides by 12 36 divided by 12 is 3. so we have 3 is equal to 2 times dht 3 divided by 2 is 1.5 so the height is changing at 1.5 feet per minute that's how much that's how fast the water level is increasing as what is being poured into the trough so that's the htt it's positive 1.5 feet per minute ","in this video we're going to talk about the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus now some books may call it the first part but you can go with whatever your textbook says so the basic idea is that you have a function f and it's continuous on the closed interval a b and capital f represents the anti-derivative of lowercase f so in that case then according to the fundamental theorem of calculus the definite integral of f of x that's lower case f x on the interval a to b that's equal to f of x evaluated from a to b which is f of b minus f of a so this theorem describes the process by which we can evaluate a definite integral so let's go over some examples go ahead and evaluate this particular integral feel free to pause the video if you want to try the anti-derivative of 3x using the power rule is going to be 3x to the second power divided by 2 and the anti-derivative of 4 is 4x so let's evaluate it from two to five so f of five is going to be three times five squared over two minus four times five minus f of 2 so if we plug in 2 into f of x now keep in mind this is lower case f of x and this represents the capital f x the anti-derivative of f so this is f of five minus f of two so that's going to be three times two squared over two minus four times two now 5 squared is 25 4 times 5 is 20. 2 squared is 4 divided by 2 that's 2 and 3 times 2 is 6. 4 times 2 is 8. now 3 times 25 is 75 6 minus 2 is negative 2 times this negative sign so that's a positive 2. negative 20 plus 2 is negative 18. now we need to get common denominators so this is going to be 75 over 2 minus 36 over 2 and 75 minus 36 that's going to be 39 and that's the final answer 39 divided by 2. let's work on some more examples so use the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral now before we could find the anti-derivative we should foil this expression so what we have is 2x minus 3 multiplied by another 2x minus 3. so first we have 2x times 2x and that's going to give us 4x squared and then it's 2x times negative 3 so that's negative 6x and negative three times two x is negative six x and then negative three times negative three that is positive nine so now what we need to do is combine like terms and this is supposed to be a 4. negative 6 minus 6 is negative 12. so this is what we now have now lowercase f is 4x squared minus 12x plus 9. now we need to find the antiderivative capital f of x now let's start at the top so the antiderivative of x squared is going to be x cubed over three and for x it's x squared over two and the antiderivative of a constant it's going to be the constant times the variable of integration which is x so this is capital f of x and we're going to evaluate it from one to four so we have now is f of x one to four and that's equal to f of four minus f of one so let's start with f of four let's plug in four into that expression so it's gonna be four times 4 raised to the third power divided by 3 and 12 divided by 2 is 6 so it's going to be 6 times 4 squared plus 9 times four and then minus f of one so one to the third is one times four over three and one squared times six is just six and then plus nine times one or nine now four to the third power that's 64 and if we multiply that by four we're going to have 256 divided by three four squared is 16 16 times 6 is 96 and 9 times 4 is 36 and then we have minus four thirds and if we distribute the negative sign plus six minus nine so the first thing we could do is combine these two fractions because they share the same denominator 256 minus 4 is 252. negative 96 plus 36 that's negative 60 and 6 minus 9 that's negative 3. now 252 divided by 3 is 84. and 60 minus well negative 16 minus 3 is negative 63 so 84 minus 63 is 21 and that is the final answer let's work on this example find a definite integral from 1 to 4 of the square root of 5 over x so what do you think we should do in this problem well first we can rewrite the expression like this it's equivalent to the square root of 5 divided by the square root of x and the square root of 5 is a constant which we can move that to the front and so this is what we now have we can rewrite the square root of x as x raised to the one half and we're not done rewriting so now we need to take the x variable move it to the top so we could use the power rule so this is x raised to the negative one-half and now we can use the power rule so negative one-half plus one is one-half and then we need to divide that by a half which if you multiply the top and bottom by two over two one half times two is one so we just put the two on top and we're going to evaluate this from 1 to 4. so what we now have is 2 square root 5 times the square root of x from 1 to 4. so let's plug in 4 first and then we could plug in one so the square root of four is two and the square root of one well that's one and two times two is four so we have 4 square root 5 and 2 times 1 is 2 and then we can subtract the coefficients so 4 minus 2 is 2. so the final answer is 2 square root 5 and that's it let's work on one final problem use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate this integral so what techniques should we employ because the 4 is a constant i'm going to move it to the front so this is equivalent to 1 4 and then we're integrating x plus the square root of x which is x to the one half the antiderivative of x is x squared over two and for x to the one half it's going to be x to the three over two divided by three over two or multiplied by two over three so now we can evaluate it so let's plug in one first so it's going to be one squared over two so that's one half and then one raised to the three halves is just one so that's gonna be plus two thirds and then if we plug in zero everything is going to be zero zero squared is zero and zero raised to the three over two is zero so we're left with one fourth times one-half plus two-thirds so we need to get common denominators so i'm going to multiply one-half by three over three and two thirds i'm going to multiply that by two over two so i'm going to have three over six and two times two is four three times two is six and then three plus four is seven so it's seven over six times one fourth seven times one is seven four times six is twenty four so the answer is seven over twenty four and that's it for this video you ","in but there's trig functions we notice that the sine of x is in the denominator and cosine x is in the numerator this is perfect for substitution sine is derivative is cosine so let's let u be equal to sine of x not the other way around the derivative of sine is cosine of x so up top there we have exactly d u with a negative 2 out there so then we replace and we end up with this integral not so scary looking but still kind of bad focus on the denominator how does it factor u plus 3 u plus 1 now you're looking at partial fractions our job unsimplify this break this into two separate fractions each with a constant on top of the denominator factors now it's our job to figure out what these constants are a and b imagine trying to put them back together you would multiply by the other denominator and so a would be multiplied by u plus 1 and b would be multiplied by u plus 3. in order to give you the original numerator back negative 2. this is true for all u so we're going to pick u smartly if we pick u equals negative 1 we don't need to worry about a because it'll be multiplied by zero and quickly it'll tell us that b is negative one next we're going to pick u equals negative three we don't have to worry about b even though we know what b is and that'll quickly tell us what a is tells us that a is equal to one so now we arrive at a place where we're happy and we weren't happy to begin with with a u substitution we got to a better place partial fractions we are where we need to be at now why because we can integrate this these are just natural logs natural log of u plus 3 minus the natural log of u plus 1 plus a constant we can put them together into one single log using log properties log of a minus log of b is the log of a over b all right we're done not quite the function came to us in terms of x the antiderivative should come to us in terms of x let's go back into x replace all those u's with the sine of x that's our answer that's the function who has the original um integrand as its derivative but technicality we don't want sine of x to be negative one division by zero so we're going to avoid that by saying that you can't have 3 pi over 2 or any multiple of 2 pi times that plus that sorry that's it thank you like and subscribe comment down below follow all that my name is nikaiah rimmer calcoach.com ","hi everyone my name is precious in this video we want to look at the concept of uh the differential equations okay so it's a new chapter and a series that we want to get into so first of all we're beginning with definitions so what is a differential equation pardon me with this short form of writing D equation that's for differential equations okay so we say it's an equation that consists of basically three things one a dependent variable y an independent variable X and then one or more derivatives of Y which is the dependent variable so you recall that Y is a dependent variable if it is a function of X so for instance if I write Y is equal to let's say 2 X plus one so it means that y depends on X and so for me to find the value of y I would need X so if I give different values of X I will get different values of Y okay so in that case you say that Y is a dependent variable of X which is the independent variable okay so now it's when we now have an equation remember an equation is just an expression that contains a quality sign so if you have an equation that contains also a dependent variable an independent variable and one or more derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the independent we say that we have a differential equation now we the implication is that we actually obtain a differential equation on by taking the derivative of a function with respect to the independent variable for instance if I differentiate this function here y equal to 2x plus 1 I'm going to get the Y now with respect to X is going to be equal to 2. so this has actually produced a differential equation if I transfer these two to this side I'll get the y d x minus 2 is equal to zero so this is a differential equation now before we continue into our definition I would like you to note that you can write the y d x this way you can also write it as y Prime and then in some cases we can write it as F Prime of X so but in this course or in this chapter we are going to be taking either this prime or this so in other words if it is for higher derivative maybe D Squared y all over these x squared so you can as well write this as y prime prime and that is what we have here here and so on so another way you can write this is you can actually write it this way y to the power of 2 that the two will be in a bracket that bracket now shows that this is a derivative of the second order but if you don't put this bracket it just means y squared okay so and that's why we have n that's Wireless power of n here in bracket so that and then means nth derivative depending on the number if it is the third derivative um whatever the case is okay so now here we have said that a differential equation consists of the dependent variable y the independent variable X and some derivatives of Y so it could be you know the first derivative or it could also contain up to second derivative or third derivative as the case may be so that's why what we have here so for instance I've given an example here you can also have other examples I can give you something like 2y Prime Prime C minus three y prime plus maybe four Y is equal to zero this is a differential equation and it contains Y and uh y derivative now what is more important is y derivative in other words if I write d y d x is equal to zero this is actually a differential equation you you can actually say there is no y here or there is no X here but there is because this is the same thing as a d y d x so I can say multiplied by y zero plus a zero x equal to zero something like this so you can see there's actually Y and there's actually X and so it contains all of that so let's quickly see some examples now these are examples of differential equations you can see the y d x minus y sine X equal to zero so there is a derivative of y that is y here and there is X here and that's equal to zero now this is another one and the same with this other two examples you can see this one is to the third derivative and then here you have y multiplying the second derivative sorry first derivative equal to two x okay so I haven't seen examples of a differential equation and I haven't seen how actually we got differential equation which is just the result of a differentiation remember we have done differentiation under calculus so when you take the derivative of a form function the equation that results from it is a differential equation so now we need to look at some types of differential equations and to Define these types we need some Concepts that we want to explain so the first thing we want to Define is the order of the differential equation and so now we said that the order of a differential equation is the highest derivative present in that differential equation so like you can see in these examples here the highest derivative here is one that's for example one the highest derivative here is two this one is the highest derivative is two and the highest derivative here is three so the order here like I already said earlier is one the other here is true because the highest order present uh is two this case is also two and in this case the order here is three okay so now that means you can actually classify differential equations according to order and so you have what we call the first order derivatives which is the first order differential equations which are the ones like this you have the second order which are the ones that have at least you know a second order derivative like this and then which is also this and this one is a third order differential equation okay so another way we can classify differential equations is the concept of degree of a differential equation so what's the degree so we said that the power of the highest derivative presence is the degree of the equation so if you come into a differential equation and you determine the order once you determine that then the next thing is to find the power of that particular derivative whatever is the power is the degree of your differential equation look at this for instance now this is the the only derivative we have here and of course the power of this is one okay so that means this is actually of other whereas this one now now watch this second example here you can see that the highest power present here is four but the degree of a differential equation is not the highest power it is rather the power of the highest derivative present and this derivative current power 4 is the second derivative that there is a third derivative present and so it is that highest derivative that you would check the power but and in this case the power is two therefore the degree of this equation is not four it is rather what two and then example three I purposely brought that example so that you can see now in this case here you have two derivatives of other one another two so how do you know the degree of this differential equation you don't just say it is one because the derivative year or sorry the power here is one that will not be correct so how do you determine this now whenever there is the presence of a square root or a fractional index there is need to first of all clear that fractional index ensure that the index of every term here is the whole number before you will be able to get the right degree of that particular differential equation so to do that for this example four we will Square every the sorry both sides of the equation and if we Square this so you have three over two then the square will multiply and then on the right hand side you have a y prime prime all squared so you have not done anything of course this will take away this to now give you y Prime raised to the power of 3 is equal to Y prime prime raised to the power of 2 and as it is now you can now determine the degree of this equation which is actually equal to what two because of course the highest the order here is two and so the power of the highest order is also two okay so that's for order and the green and so the next thing that gives us classifications of differential equations is the linearity so what then is a linear differential equation so a differential equation is linear if the dependent variable and or its derivative present in the differential equation is also linear so if the both of them if you have the derivative and the Y present in that differential equation then both of them must be linear also and what do you mean by being linear that means the power must be one so if there is any derivative present the power must be one then if your Y is present in that differential equation its power must be one secondly there must be no product of Y and any of its derivative so if you have in a differential equation Y multiplying y Prime for instance equal to anything may be equal to today's a differential equation of course this is not linear okay because there is a product of Y and its derivative right and then the third thing that now helps you determine linearity is that why and any of its derivative must not must not be the argument of a transcendental function and what's a transcendental function that's a function functions of a log exponents um trigonometric functions okay of course these are basic transcendental functions so if I have something like cos y or sine y present in a differential equation automatically that differential equation is not linear if I have something like sine y prime or exponential y or log y maybe lean y present in a differential equation it automatically makes it not linear so let's look at this example can we quickly you know classify these ones okay look at this the power of Y here is 2 that's not linear what is the case here you can see of course the powers are all one that's for Y and Y Prime and then there is no product and there is the transcendental function here which is exponent is carrying X so that means this one is linear so what about the SEC the third the third is also linear check that and be sure and so what about the fourth the fourth is not linear not linear because there is a COS y here our Y is the argument of a trig function and then lastly what is the let me see what you can do with this one let me allow you to do this as an exercise is it linear or not linear kindly drop your answer in the comment section below and this is where we'll end it for this video kindly subscribe to our YouTube channel we'll see you in our next content bye thank you ","in this video we're going to focus on solving differential equations by means of separating variables so let's start with this example problem dydx is equal to x^2 / y^2 now in this problem what we need to do is separate the variables on one side we only want to have y variables and on the other side of the equation we only want to have X variables so since we have a fraction separated by an equal sign Let's cross multiply Dy * y^2 is simply y^2 Dy and on the other side it's going to be x^2 DX now that we've separated the variables we can integrate both sides of the function the anti-derivative of y^2 is YB / 3 the anti-derivative of x^2 is XB / 3 and on one side of the equation you need to add a constant C so now let's get y by itself so let's multiply both sides of the equation by three so it's going to be y Cub is equal to xq + 3 C now 3 C is a constant so we can just write C for the total sum of all constants so you can rewrite this as y y Cub is equal to X Cub plus C and so this is the answer now if you want to you can take the cube root of both sides and simplify it further so Y is equal to the cube root of x Cub + C so this is the general solution now let's say if we want to find a particular solution if we're given an initial condition let's say y of 1 is equal to 2 if you're given a point an X and Y value you need to solve for c y is equal to 2 and X is equal to 1 so in order to get C by itself we need to raise both sides to the thir power 2 the 3 is equal to 8 the cube of a cube root cancels and it's just going to be 1 plus c so we could see that 7 is equal to C so the particular solution is y equal to the cube root of x Cub + 7 so this is the general solution and this is the particular solution given the initial condition let's work on another example let's say that y Prime is equal to x * y go ahead and pause the video and see if you can get this answer and let's say that the initial condition is y0 is equal to 5 you can also view this as the point 0 comma 5 x is z and y is 5 so let's begin y Prime is the same as dy over DX so we need to separate X and Y and let's begin by multiplying both sides by DX so therefore Dy is equal to XY DX now let's divide both sides by y so on the left what we have now is 1 y Dy and this is equal to X DX so now let's find the anti-derivative of both sides the anti-derivative of 1 y is the natural log of Y or I'm just going to write it as Ln Y and the anti-derivative of X is x^2 / 2 + C so now what do you think we should do at this point at this point what we can do is Place both sides of the function on the exponents of e if Ln y isal x^2 2 + C then then e to the Ln Y is equal to e 12 x^2 + C since the bases are the same then the exponents are equal to each other now e to the Ln y notice that natural log always have a base e these will cancel and so you just get y on the left side and that's equal to e raised to 12 x^2 + C now how can we separate X2 and C now it's important to understand that x^2 * X cube is equal to x 2 + 3 which is X 5th power whenever you multiply by Common bases you need to add exponents so therefore the reverse is true let's say if we have X raised to 4 + 7 we could separate 4 and 7 by rewriting as x 4 time x 7th the same way as we did it here so therefore we could separate the 12x^2 from C by means of multiplication so this is e 12x^2 time e to the C now e rais to the C is a constant so we could simply replace that with C therefore the general solution is y is equal to C * e raised to 12 x^2 now the last thing that we need to do is find a particular solution so we said that y of 0 is equal to 5 so let's find the value of the constant C so Y is 5 and x is 0 0 2 is 0 * a half that's Z so what we have is e raised to the 0 power anything raised to 0 power is equal to 1 so therefore we could see that c is equal to five so the particular solution is 5 e raised to the 12 x^2 and so that's the answer to this problem and here is the general solution here's another problem for you let's say that Dy / DX is equal to y^2 + 1 and let's say that you're given an initial condition F of one is equal to Z or rather y of one is equal to zero so go ahead and find the general solution and the particular solution to this differential equation so feel free to pause the video and work on this example now let's begin let's start by multiplying both sides sides by DX so what we now have is dy is equal to y^2 + 1 * DX so we need to move the Y variable to the other side and the best way to do that to separate it from DX is to divide both sides by y^2 + 1 let's rewrite it as one over y^2 + 1 * Dy and that's equal to DX so now let's find the anti-derivative of both sides so what is the anti-derivative of 1 y^2 + 1 well it helps to know that the derivative of the inverse tangent of X is equal to 1 over 1 + x^2 so this is going to be the anti-derivative I mean the anti-derivative of 1 y^2 + 1 is inverse tangent y so that's what we're going to have on the left side on the right side the anti-derivative of DX is simply 1 X plus C or just X plus c now what would you do at this point what we need to do is take the tangent of both sides of the equation that's how we can separate inverse tangent from y tangent and inverse tangent these two cancel so on the left side this is going to be Y is equal to tangent x + C so this is the general equation now we were given an initial point Y of 1 is equal to Z so let's replace y with zero and x with one and let's solve for C tangent of what angle is equal to one I mean zero not one tangent of 0 is equal to Z tangent of Pi is equal to Z as well but let's use this one so therefore 1 + C has to be equal to zero which means that c is equal to 1 so one of the particular Solutions is y is equal to tangent X - 1 now granted I guess you you can set 1 plus Cal to Pi you could do that for 2 pi 3 pi and it's just going to keep on going but I just chose one of those answers and here's one particular solution ","population for drupal will be 9.97 hello guys i hope you're doing great in this video i'll be explaining to you a particular application of first order linear differential equations the first most common application is when you have a quantity the rate of change in that quantity is directly proportional to the value of that quantity at a particular instant instead of explaining the theory in this part because we have already looked at all the theory in the previous videos we can directly go and solve the problems so i'm going to show you the solution to problem one which is from exercise number 3.1 of zell and kallenbook 7th edition so the problem states that the population of a community is known to increase at a rate proportional to the number of people present at time t so how do we go about translating this sentence into mathematics so first of all we know that there is something called a population right so what we can do is we can say that we are representing population with capital p and this population is changing with respect to time so we say that time can be denoted with t so now what we are saying is that population is a function of time and it is directly proportional to the rate of change of population at that time so this is how we translate this sentence or this problem into a differential equation so this is not a proper differential equation yet so what do we need to do we need to take away the proportionality sign and introduce a constant of proportionality so d p of t by dt i'm flipping the left hand side and the right hand side equals k times p of t where k is the constant of proportionality and to solve these problems we are normally given with more information so the further information that is given it is that if an initial population p0 has doubled in five years how long will it take to triple and to quadruple it is an initial value problem and initial values are used for real life applications initial value or initial population is called p0 so we we are using p0 this p0 could be any value it could be a number of people like thousand two thousand it could also be constant uh like p0 so the information that we are given with is that the initial population p0 has doubled in five years so when time goes from 0 to 5 the population p of t goes from p 0 to 2 p 0 right so this is how we can you know translate that statement into maths so now the big question the big question is how do we use this information to solve this differential equation the answer to that is that we don't do that right away first we solve the differential equation for its general solution so i am going to solve this differential equation for its general solution and then i am going to use the initial values into that solution for the sake of gravity i am going to use simple p instead of p of t okay so i'm going to use the equation dp by dt equals k times p so now i'm going to rearrange this equation just like i'm taking everything in p on the left hand side and everything as a constant or a function of time or anything like that on the right hand side then i'm going to take the integral on both sides so when i take integral on both sides the left-hand side integral is natural log of p and the right hand side will be k t and there will be a constant of integration this is standard solution that we have already done a couple of times in previous videos so how do we get rid of this natural log because we would like to have a solution in terms of p only we make all of the this equation a function of exponent e so on the left hand side we get e to the power natural log of p equal to the right hand side is e to the power kt plus c and we can further write it down as it's a property of log that we can interchange e and p so we can write it down p to the power natural log of e equal to e to the power kt and we can uh you know separate this exponent based on the power so the natural log of e is one so on the left hand side we get p and on the right hand side we get e to the power c we also name this as let's say capital c so on the right hand side we get capital c e to the power kt right so this is the equation and you must have noticed that in this equation we have two unknowns first unknown is c and the second unknown is k and we have we are given with some information which we had written over here so let's use this information to find out the values of c and k so we know that at time 0 the population was p0 and at time 5 or 5 years the population became twice that of the initial population p0 so whereas the function of or the solution of p of t we have just found out to be c e to the power k t right so let's uh translate all of this equation for time t equal to 0 what do we get we get p at time 0 equal to c e to the power k multiplied by 0 so we on the left hand side i can change p of 0 as p 0 because we have already named or given with a value of p at time equal to 0 as p 0 and on the right hand side we get c so we can say that we have got the value of the constant of integration which is p0 this is first finding so as i said earlier if p0 was given to be as a number or 1000 or 2000 or anything like that it would be different but it's okay to use any named constant as well so now we need to find the value of k and to find the value of k we what what are we going to do we're going to use the second information we're going to use the second information that at time t equal to 5 the population doubles so let's write down the same general solution at time equal to 5. so we get p of 5 equal to c e to the power k into 5 because now we are looking at this equation at t equal to 5. now after 5 years the population doubled so now here i am going to write 2 p 0 i have already written it over here at 5 years the population doubles right so on the right hand side we have already found the value of c which is p 0 so i'm going to write down that thing and here we have a to the power 5 k p 0 obviously cancels out and we're left with e to the power 5 k equal to 2 and now we have to find the value of k from this so i'm going to take natural log on both sides so i can write it down natural log of e to the power 5 k equal to natural log of 2 so the left hand side becomes 5 k into natural log of e because anything in the power can be brought outside of the log that is a property of log and on the right hand side i get natural log of 2 so the value of k becomes natural log of 2 divided by 5 natural log of and by the way natural log of e is 1. so all of this will be 1 so we don't need to write that so the answer to this will be [Music] 0.139 so now we can use this value of k into the general solution and we got a particular solution and that will be that p of t equals now the value of c was we found it for as p0 so p0 and e to the power kt so k we just found out to be 0.139 and here it will be t so now let's uh go to their question that their question was how long will it take for this population to triple right so we want to find the value of t when p 0 will become 3 p 0. so on the left hand side i am going to write down 3 p 0 because we are interested in a population which is 3 times the initial population right and on the right hand side i'm going to i'm not going to change anything because we don't have any more information about this scenario p0 cancels out and just like in the previous steps we will have uh e to the power 0.139 t equal to 3 and we we're going to take the natural log on both sides and we get the value of t will be natural log of 3 divided by 0.139 so the answer to this becomes 7.9 so the population will triple after almost eight years whereas the population doubled after five years right so the last part of this problem is how much how how how long will it take to quadruple so we are going to repeat all of this for the value of 4 p0 so instead of 3 we're going to write 4 now and instead of 3 here it is also going to be 4 here it is also going to be 4 and the answer for the population to quadruple will be 9.97 years so the population doubles after approximately eight years and the population quadruples after almost 10 years so i hope you understood how we use first order linear differential equations in real life problems i leave you with the problem so please try to do this problem that the population of bacteria in a culture grows at a rate proportional to the number of bacteria present and at time t this is problem four so you can easily see that this is exactly the same problem of population that we earlier did after that it says that after three hours it is observed that 400 bacteria are present and after 10 hours 2000 bacteria are present what was the initial number of bacteria so this is just a flipped problem of this problem and in which you're supposed to find p0 instead of a given p0 so please try to attempt this problem and write down the answers in the comments below and subscribe for staying in touch and we'll see you in next video ","hey what's going on its Justin dick Meyer from engineering training exam calm and in this video we're going to review higher-order non-homogeneous differential equations now let's recall that a non-homogeneous second-order linear equation takes the form y double prime plus PT y prime plus Q T Y is equal to G T where the general solution of this equation would be YT is equal to YP t plus y h t so this is the general solution of a higher-order non homey and homogeneous differential equation now YP T is known as the particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation and why HT is the general solution of the Associated homogeneous equation now we know how to find the solution to a homogeneous equation so let's focus on how we can determine the particular solution of a non-homogeneous differential equation so let's determine or let's focus on how to find YP t of the general solution now one process we can use for solving this is known as the method of undetermined coefficients so let's look at that the method of undetermined coefficients now this method is based on a guessing technique where we will guess the form of YP and then plug it into the equation to find it however this method only works under the following conditions number one the Associated homogeneous equations has constant coefficients so what the YH part of the general solution has constant coefficients in condition number two is the non-homogeneous term GT is this is is a special form so the non the non-homogeneous term G T is in a special form and that special form can be one of two things GT can be P T e to the Alpha X cosine of beta X or it could be in the form L T e to the Alpha X sine of beta X so it needs to be in one of these two forms to be able to use this method to solve and PT and L T are both polynomial functions now there are two disadvantages to this method first it will only work for a fairly small of class of gts as we've defined here the class of GT s for which this method works however does include some of the more common functions so we commonly do see these types of functions as GT however there are many functions out there for which the undetermined coefficients simply won't work second it is generally only useful for constant coefficient differential equations now this method is quite simple all we need to do is look at GT and make a guess as to the form of white the YP leaving the coefficients undetermined hence the name of the method next we would plug in the guess to the differential equation and see if we can determine the values of the coefficients if we can determine the values for the coefficients then we guessed correctly if we can't find the values for the coefficients then we guessed incorrectly and we just have to start all over so that's a lot of talk let's go through an example let's uh let's reinforce this through seeing how it works let's say we want to solve the equation y double prime minus 4y minus 12y is equal to three e to the 5t we look at GT and we see that it is in one of the forms that we can use so we'll go ahead and use the method of the method of undetermined coefficients now the point here again is to find the particular solution however the first thing that we're going to do is find the complimentary homogeneous solution to this differential equation so recall that the complete complementary solution comes from solving this equation without GCT there with where it's just zero on the right side so we can rewrite that as let's say we're dealing with H the homogeneous equation H prime minus four prime minus 12y is equal to zero now the characteristic equation here is R squared minus four R minus twelve which can be factored as R minus six times R plus two so we see that r1 is going to be equal to six and r2 it's going to be equal to - negative - so we have two real distinct roots therefore our complementary homogeneous equation y H T is going to be equal to C 1 e to the 6t plus C 2 e to the negative 2t so that's our homogeneous equation of our general solution now let's find the particular solution we need to make a guess as to the form of the particular solution to this differential equation since G T is an exponential and we know that Exponential's never just appear or disappear in the differentiation process it seems that a likely form of the particular solution would be Y P T some constant e to the 5 T because e does just doesn't disappear does not just appear either so that's a good guess to start with now all that we need to do is do a couple of derivatives and plug this into the differential equation and see if we can determine what a would equal and if we can do that then our guess was right so let's go ahead and do a couple derivatives and so we got Y double prime is going to be equal to 25 e to the 5t Y prime is going to be equal to 5 e to the 5 t and we already know what Y is so let's go ahead and just plug these values into our differential equation we got 25 a to the e 5 2 raised to the 5t minus 4 a 4 times 5 a e to the 5 t minus 12a e to the 5 T is equal to 3 e to the 5t combining all these terms on left side we get negative 7a e to the 5 T is equal to 3 e to the 5 T so things are looking good it looks like we're gonna be able to solve for a and in fact we are and just isolating a we solve a is equal to negative 3/7 so we found a value for the coefficient this means that we guessed correctly now our particular solution for this differential equation now will be Y P T is equal to negative 3/7 e to the 5 T that's our particular solution so all we need to do is we'll jump up here we just need to now combine our homogeneous solution and our particular solution to get the overall solution of the equation so we have negative 3/7 e to the 5t plus C 1 e to the 6t plus C 2 e to the negative 2t and there it is that is our solution using the method of undetermined coefficients so let's look at another example here let's look at another example and see what happens when our guess is initially wrong and what we can do to address that so just follow along we're gonna guess something and it's going to be wrong and I'll show you how we can adjust quickly on-the-fly to get the answer correctly let's find the particular solution for y double prime minus 4 y prime minus 12 y is equal to sine of 12 I'm sorry it's sine of 2t that's 2 sine of 2t now we want to start off by finding the complementary homogeneous solution before we proceed on to determining the particular solution notice though this solution will be the same as the first problem we just went over it's the same on the left side so we won't go through the mess we've remembered we can just recall it at the end of this problem now recall in the last problem that we were dealing with an exponential function function as G sub G of T so we guess that our particular solution would include an exponential as well and we guessed right now this differential equation has a sign so let's start with our guess as y PT is equal to a sine of 2t and let's see what happens so differentiating that a couple times and plugging it back into our differential equation we get negative 4 a sine of 2t minus 4 2 times a cosine of 2t minus 12 a sine of 2t is equal to sine of 2t now combining all the like terms we get negative 16 a sine of 2t minus 8 cosine 8 times a cosine 2t is equal to sine of 2t now we need to define a so that we can get the same function on both sides of the equal sign we do this by setting the cosines and sines from each side against one another so that cosine of 2t is equal to negative 8 a is equal to zero because there's no cosine on the right side here now there's a negative 8 cosine on the left side so in this case a has to equal zero now we saw set the signs against each other we got let's see we got for the signs we got negative 16 on the left and we have one on the right so that means a has to be negative 1 16 so these constants obviously are not the same so since there's no cosine on the right hand side this means that the coefficient must be zero on that side however in order for the cosine to drop out as it must in order for the guests to satisfy the differential equation we need to set a equals to zero but a equal to zero then the sine will also drop out and that can't happen because we have sine on the right sides so likewise reverse we need a to equal negative 1/16 to equal the number of signs on the right side but if we plug that 8 into our cosine on the right side then that's not going to satisfy our equation for the right side for the cosine so this means that since there's two values for a you don't have to go through all that blur 'bitch that I just went through but since there's two values of a it's obviously that our guests was wrong luckily we kind of worked through the problem already which shows us to how we can fix our guests we notice that on the left side when we differentiate that we're going to have a combination of sines and cosines so let's start our next guest as our particular solution as a cosine of 2t plus B sine of 2t now plugging this into the differential equation we can differentiate this and plug it into our original differentiate differential equation we get negative 4 a cosine of 2t minus 4b sine of 2t minus four negative to a sine of 2t plus two B cosine of 2t minus 12 a cosine of 2t plus B sine of 2t is equal to sine of 2t so that's a mega long equation but let's let's simplify that a little bit we got negative 4a minus 8 b -12 a cosine of 2t plus negative 4b plus 8 a minus 12 B sine of 2t it's equal to sine of 2t and simplifying that just a little bit more we get negative 16 a minus 8 B cosine of 2t plus 8 a minus 16 B sine of 2t is equal to sine of 2t so once again we need to set the coefficients sine and cosine equal to each other from the left and right because each side of this equation needs to equal to determine what a and B would be so for cosine we're going to get negative 16 a minus 8 B is equal to 0 because there's negative 16 days cosines on the left side and negative 8b cosines on the left side and then there's zero on the right so sine of 2t is going to be 8 a minus 16 B is equal to 1 now we have two equations and two unknowns so we can go ahead and solve that and we end up getting a is equal to 1 over 40 and B is equal to negative 1 over 20 so we actually found some constants for our particular solution therefore our guess was correct and now all we need to do is define that particular solution let's start anew let's just plug our numbers into our equation we got 1 over 40 cosine of 2t minus 1 divided by 20 sine of 2t so that is our particular solution for this specific higher-order non homogeneous linear differential equation so all we need to do now is combine that with our original homogeneous solution and we would get the overall solution to the problem so that's all I got for you guys if you have any more questions or concerns or suggestions go ahead and send them at the engineer and training exam comm check out my other videos there and get on your way to dominating this exam so we'll be talking soon guys take care all right bye ","in this video we're going to learn how to solve constant coefficient differential equations this video was part of my larger playlist on differential equations the link to that playlist into the free and open source textbook that accompanies it is down in the description so what is a constant coefficient differential equation well if i look at this one y double prime minus y prime minus 6y is equal to 0 the coefficient of the dependent variable y and its derivatives are all just numbers one at the very front even though it's not written down minus 1 in front of the y prime and minus 6 in front of the y so it's not just the linear differential equation it's a constant coefficient ones the coefficients are not even allowed to be functions of x they have to be actually constants and this is a second order constant coefficient differential equation because the highest derivative is two indeed this is our first example of an order two differential equation all our previous examples were ordered one so what's our methodology now it's kind of interesting we're going to make a guess i'm going to guess what the answer to this is i'm going to guess that it's of the form e to the rt where r is some number that i don't know now it's at this point not at all obvious why we should guess e to the rt but let's just suppose that that is the solution and see what happens so i'm going to do that i'm going to plug in this solution everywhere so two derivatives of e to the rt gives me r squared e to the rt then it's a minus r times e to the r2 and you take one derivative and finally minus six e to the rt equal to zero so that's me just substituting this guess into this differential equation and by the way in differential equations is totally okay to guess this is kind of like with integration if you can guess an antiderivative and it works out power to you now i do notice that there's an e to the rt everywhere so why don't i cancel those e to the rt is positive so i can do it and that just leaves me something that's called the characteristic equation so this is a polynomial r squared minus r minus six equal to zero that's a polynomial in the variable r that thing we introduce when we guess e to the r t so if there is a solution of this form it must be the case that the r solves this particular quadratic equation i can solve that quadratic equation i can factor it easily r minus 3 r plus 2 and that gives me two different solutions to the r and r one which was three and an r two which is minus two so i made my guess of e to the rt and i've decided that the only way the r could work out is if it was one of these two answers okay so if i just look at those pieces here is my general solution to this second order constant coefficient differential equation i know it's a mouthful it's well the possible ways that i could add up exponentials of this form and e to the 3t that was our first root and e to the minus 2t that was our second root and then coefficients of c1 and c2 and it turns out that's it that's all i need indeed as we saw in the previous video when we just talked big picture about the theory of second order differential equations we said that what we needed to find to get a general solution was two different linearly independent solutions and e to the 3t and e to the minus 2t are linearly independent they're certainly not a multiple of each other so these are two different solutions they're literally independent and thus the general solution by our theory has to be written in this way a linear combination of these two solutions c1 e to the first root times t and c2 e to the second root times t okay so that's the solution to this differential equation but what would happen if i also had an initial condition but i actually have a c1 and a c2 two different constants so i need to have two different initial conditions so i'm going to specify i'm just making these numbers up that y of 0 is 1 and that y prime of 0 was equal to 2. i'm going to have two different initial conditions to find the two different constants to my two different solutions to my second order differential equations it always works like that so how can i deal with this well one initial condition is in terms of y and the other is in terms of y prime it's a y prime of 0. so let me go ahead and take the derivative of this to get my y prime as well just taking the derivative e to the 3t becomes 3 e to the 3t and so forth now let me substitute in my two differential equations for the first one y of 0 is equal to 1. basically for y i plug in 1 and everywhere there's a t i plug in 0. as e to the 0 is just 1 this is just going to become c 1 plus c 2. so that's my first initial condition plugged in let's do the second okay so now i have to plug this into the derivative so y prime is going to be 2. i plug in 0 again and again the exponentials are going to be going to just 1. and so i get c1 times 3 minus c2 times 2. so this is what happens when i take my two different initial conditions and plug them into my solution and to the derivative of my solution let's get rid of a bunch of the extra fluff here and what i just have is two equations two unknowns i can solve this this is a linear system of equations maybe i'll look at the first one first the 1 equal to c1 plus c2 and i can solve that saying c1 is 1 minus c2 then if i take 1 minus c2 and plug it into the second equation you're going to get well 1 minus c2 times 3 and then minus c2 times 2. i can rearrange this clean it all up it's 3 minus 5 c2 and now if i look at this equation 2 minus 3 is minus 1 minus 1 equal to minus 5 c2 c2 has to equal to one-fifth and as soon as i know what the c2 is i can look back at my previous equation that c1 was 1 minus c2 unless my c1 is four-fifths so i've now solved my two constants in my general solution it was a c one e to the three t and a c two e to the minus two t but i now know what the c one and the c two is i can just plug them in and so my final answer to this initial value problem is four fifths e to the three t and one-fifth e to the minus two t now this was all great as a first example however there's multiple different types of cases that can come up when you solve a second order constant coefficient differential equation so in the next video we're going to dive a little bit more into the general methodology the general theory of how to solve all the different second order constant coefficient differential equations just like this one so if you like this video please do give it a like for the youtube algorithm if you have any questions do leave them down in the comments below and let's do some more math in the next video ","in this video we're going to talk about how to solve second order homogeneous differential equations using the method of undetermined coefficients so the example problem that we're going to work on is this one y double prime plus five y prime plus six y is equal let's fix that y is equal to x squared now this particular equation is a homogeneous differential equation it's in the form a y prime i mean a y double prime plus b y prime plus c y is equal to g of x since g of x is not zero because it's x squared we have a homogeneous i mean a non-homogeneous or non-homogeneous differential equation to find the general solution we need to use this formula y of x is going to equal y sub p of x plus y sub c of x now y sub p of x that is the particular solution of the non-homogeneous differential equation now there's another equation that we need to talk about and it is the homogeneous differential equation in the form a y prime plus b y prime i mean a y double prime plus b y prime plus c y is equal to zero so that is the homogeneous differential equation since we can see that g of x is zero now solving the homogeneous equation will give us y of c combining those two will give us the general solution to our original non-homogeneous differential equation so i'm going to talk about how we can do everything but for now just make sure you have these three equations by the way this video builds on another video that i created entitled second order linear differential equations which explains how to solve homogeneous differential equations you may want to watch that video if you haven't done so already before continuing to watch this one so let's go ahead and continue with this problem now the first thing that we're going to do is solve the homogeneous differential equation where g is equal to zero so we have this auxiliary equation a r squared plus b r plus c is equal to zero so we could see that a is one b is five c is six to factor this trinomial we need two numbers that multiply to six but add to the middle coefficient five so that's gonna be two and three so we can factor it as r plus two times r plus three and so we get r is equal to negative two and r is equal to minus three so we have two real solutions which means we're dealing with case number two of solving our homogeneous differential equation so the general solution is going to be c one e r one x plus c two e r two x r one is minus two r two is negative three and so this is gonna be y sub c so that gives us the general solution of our complementary equation so i'm going to write that on the bottom because we're going to need that later so let's save this for the end now the next thing we need to consider is g g is equal to x squared and so y must equal a polynomial of degree two so therefore y sub p of x will have the general form ax squared plus bx plus c if we take the first derivative of that we get this the derivative of x squared is 2x so this is going to be 2ax the derivative of x is 1. so we get b now finding the second derivative of y sub p is just going to be 2 times a now we're going to take all of this information and plug it in to that function so we can replace y double prime with 2a and then y prime with 2ax plus b and y is going to be replaced with a x squared plus b x plus c and so this is going to equal x squared now what we need to do is solve for a b and c so let's distribute so we have 2a plus that's going to be 10 ax and then plus 5b distributing the 6 is going to be 6 ax squared plus 6bx plus 6c is equal to x squared there's only one term with an x squared on the left so i'm going to write that as 6a times x squared now there are two terms on the left with an x variable so i'm going to factor out the x and i'm going to have 10 a plus 6b times x and then we have three constants which i'm going to write it as 2a plus 5b plus 6c and so this is going to equal 1 x squared plus zero x plus zero so the coefficient on the right side in front of x squared is a one on the left it's a six a so we can set those two equal to each other so six a is one dividing both sides by six we can see that a is one over six so that's our first coefficient now let's move on to the next one so the coefficient in front of x is ten a plus six b and that has to equal zero replacing a with one over six we have this now to get rid of the fraction i'm going to multiply everything by 6. 10 times 1 over 6 times 6 is simply 10 and then 6b times 6 is 36b so we have 36b is equal to negative 10. dividing both sides by that we get negative 10 over 36 reducing that fraction half of 10 is 5 half of 36 is 18. so b is negative 5 over now for the next one this must equal zero so we have two a plus five b plus six c equals zero so we're gonna replace a with one over six and b with negative five over eighteen now let's solve for c so to get rid of both or the two fractions that we have let's multiply everything by eighteen eighteen divided by six is three times two that's six here the 18s will cancel so we have five times negative five that's negative 25 and then six times eighteen that's going to be 108. 6 minus 25 is negative 19. so moving that to the other side we have 108c is equal to 19 so c is 19 over 108. so now that we have the values of a b and c we can now write our answer so we said that y sub p of x is in the form ax squared plus bx plus c so substituting those in it's going to be 1 over 6 x squared minus 5 over 18 x plus whoops 19 over 108. now the general solution to the non-homogeneous differential equation is going to be y sub c plus y sub p so now this is when we're going to put everything together so let's start with y sub c which we have right here so that's c1 e to the negative 2x plus c2 e to the minus 3x next we need to add y sub p which is what we have here so that's plus one over six x squared minus five over eighteen x plus 19 over 108 so this right here is the solution to the non-homogeneous second order linear differential equation now let's move on to the next example let's say we have y double prime plus 9y and let's say that's equal to e to the 2x go ahead and solve this differential equation so first let's write the homogeneous differential equation where g of x is equal to 0. now keep in mind we're missing zero y squared so i'm going to write it here so now we need to determine the values of a b and c so we could see that a is one b is zero c is not so we have r squared plus nine is equal to zero moving the nine to the other side we have this taking the square root of both sides r is plus or minus 3i so r1 is going to be 0 plus 3i r2 is 0 minus 3i so for this homogenous differential equation we have two imaginary solutions so this is case number three so keep in mind r1 is equal to alpha plus beta i so we can see that alpha is equal to zero beta is equal to three so the general form of our complementary equation the general solution rather is going to be for case number three it's e alpha x times c one cosine beta x plus c2 sine beta x now alpha is equal to zero and e to the zero is one so this part basically disappears and we're gonna have c1 cosine beta x but beta is three so cosine three x and then plus c two sine three x so we're going to save this equation for later so that's the general solution of the complementary equation now let's focus on our original equation notice that g is e to the 2x so yp is going to have the general form a e to the 2x our next step is to find the first derivative of that the derivative of e to the 2x is going to be it's e to the 2x times the derivative of 2x which is 2. so we can write that as 2 a e to the 2x now to get the second derivative it's going to be 4a e to the 2x if you follow the same process now our next step is to take all of this and plug it in to the original expression so replacing y double prime with 4a e to the 2x and then we're going to replace y with a e to the 2x and that's going to equal g so these two are like terms 4a plus 9a will give us 13a e to the 2x so we could divide both sides by e to the 2x and we'll get thirteen a is equal to one so a is one over thirteen taking this and plugging it into that expression we get yp is equal to one over thirteen e to the two x so now we have everything we need to write the final solution so it's going to be yc plus yp which is c1 cosine 3x plus c2 sine 3x and then plus yp which is 1 over 13 e to the 2x and so this here is the final answer now let's move on to our third example so let's say we have y double prime plus 3y prime plus 2y and this time we're going to set it equal to cosine x so let's start with our homogeneous differential equation let's make g x equal to 0. so now underneath that let's write the auxiliary equation ar squared plus br plus c is equal to zero so we can see that a is one b is three and c is two two numbers that multiply to two and add to three are one and two so we have r plus one times r plus two and so we get two solutions r is equal to negative one and r is equal to negative two so because we have two solutions this is case number one of solving a homogeneous differential equation so our general solution will look like this this is the formula that we're going to use so replacing r1 and r2 we get that yc is c1 e to the negative x plus c2 e to the negative 2x and let's save that equation so now let's get rid of this stuff so g of x as we could see here is cosine x so we need to decide what we're going to write for y of p the derivative of cosine is negative sine and the derivative of negative sine is positive cosine so yp must contain an expression with cosine and sine so we're going to say that yp is equal to a cosine x plus b sine x now let's get the first derivative so the derivative of cosine is negative sine so we're going to have negative a sine of x the derivative of positive sign is positive cosine so this will give us b cosine x now let's move on to the second derivative the derivative of negative a sine x will be negative a cosine x and the derivative of b cosine x is negative b sine x so now let's take this information and let's substitute it into that expression by the way um write down this expression because i'm going to need the extra space so i need to get rid of it for now but just remember what it is because we're going to use it later so replacing y prime i mean y double prime with negative a cosine x minus b sine x and then we have 3 y prime so that's going to be plus 3 times negative a sine x plus b cosine x and then plus 2y so 2 times a cosine b sine and all of this is going to equal cosine x so let's combine like terms let's focus on the terms that have cosine so this is negative a cosine x plus 2a cosine x so that becomes just 1a cosine x and then we have another cosine expression that's 3b cosine x now let's focus on sine so this is negative b sine x and then 2b sine x so that gives us positive b sine x and then we have negative 3a sine x this is going to be equal to one times cosine x we don't have a sine but i'm going to write plus zero sine x let's gather all of the cosine expressions factoring out cosine we're gonna have a plus three b is equal or a plus three b times cosine and then taking out sine we're going to have b minus 3a times sine x and so that's going to be 1 cosine x plus 0 sine x now let's get rid of some of this stuff so we could set one equal to a plus three b and we could set b minus three a equal to zero i'm gonna reverse the order so i'm gonna write negative three a plus b equal to zero so let's we need to solve by substitution or by elimination rather so i'm going to multiply the first equation by three so becomes three a plus 9b is equal to 3 and i'm going to rewrite the second equation the way it is and adding these two equations we can cancel the a variable so we'll get 10 b is equal to 3 which means b is 3 over 10. so now i'm going to use this equation to solve for a so i have a plus 3b or 3 times 3 over 10 equal to 1. three times three is nine so i get nine over ten that should be a plus a plus nine over ten is equal to one so one is the same as ten over ten subtracting both sides by nine over ten we have 10 over 10 minus 9 over 10 which is 1 over 10. so now we have the values of a and b so we can plug that in into this expression to get yp so we can say that y sub p is 1 over 10 cosine x plus 3 over 10 sine x now our next step is to factor out one over ten so we're going to have cosine x plus three sine x and recall we said that y c is equal to c1 e to the negative x plus c2 e to minus 2x so y is going to be the sum of yc plus yp so the solution to our second order non-homogeneous differential equation is going to be c one e negative x plus c two e minus two x plus one over 10 cosine x plus 3 sine x and so that's it for this example for the next problem let's try y double prime plus y is equal to cosine so like before we are going to start with our homogeneous equation so we have y double prime plus zero y prime plus y is equal to zero and then right in our auxiliary equation right below it we have this we can see a is one b is zero so that disappears and c is one so r squared plus one is equal to zero which means that r squared is equal to negative one taking the square root of both sides we get two imaginary or two complex solutions so r one is going to be zero minus one i r two going to be 0 plus 1i now the reason why i wrote it this way is so you can clearly see what alpha and beta are equal to well this is going to be in the form alpha minus beta and this one is alpha plus beta times i nevertheless you can see that alpha is zero beta is one so the general solution for this homogeneous equation is going to be e alpha x c 1 cosine beta x plus c 2 sine beta x alpha is 0 so e to the zero is one so we can get rid of that beta is one so the general solution for this homogeneous equation will be c one cosine one x plus c c2 sine 1x so let's save this for later now g of x is cosine x and typically for yp we would use a cosine x plus b sine x however for this example problem this is not going to be practical because notice that this expression is the same as our complementary equation so we don't want to use this expression but let's see what would happen if we did use it the first derivative is going to be the derivative of cosine is a negative sign so we're going to have negative a sine x the derivative of sine is cosine and then once we get the second derivative it's going to be negative a cosine x and then b cosine will become negative b sine x so if we were to plug in y p and y prime p into this expression that is y prime plus y notice that a cosine x will cancel with negative a cosine x b sine x will cancel negative b sine x and so in this example problem we will get zero equals cosine which we can't do anything with that so this is not going to work out very well so instead of using a cosine x plus b sine x we're going to do something different we're going to throw in an x variable into each term so instead of a cosine x we're going to have ax cosine x instead of a i mean b sine x we're going to have b x sine x so now let's get the first derivative we need to use the product rule the derivative of x is one so we're going to get a cosine x and then next we need to differentiate cosine x which will give us negative sine x so we have negative a x sine x moving on to the next term differentiating x will give us one so we're going to get b sine x and then taking the derivative of sine x that's going to be cosine positive cosine so that's going to be bx cosine x so now let's move on to the second derivative the derivative of a cosine x will be negative a sine x here we need to use the product rule differentiate an x is one so that will leave behind negative a sine x differentiate in positive sine will be cosine and so we'll get negative 8x cosine x the derivative of b sine x will be b cosine x and for this one we need to use the product rule again so differentiating x we get b times 1 times cosine x differentiating cosine will give us negative sign so we'll have negative b x sine x now let's combine like terms so we can combine these two terms so that's going to be negative 2a sine x and then minus ax cosine x the next two terms that we can combine are those two so plus 2b cosine x and then minus bx sine x so now let's take yp and y double prime and plug it in into this expression now notice once we plug in these two expressions into the left side of that equation since we're adding y double prime and y we could see that ax cosine x and negative a x cosine x will cancel and then b x sine x and negative b x on x will cancel so that's going to leave behind negative 2 a sine x plus 2b cosine x and i'm going to put this in parentheses and that's equal to cosine x but i'm going to write 0 times sine x which is nothing plus cosine x or rather let's say 1 times cosine x so we can clearly see that negative 2 a has to be equal to 0 because there is no sign on the right side so if negative 2 a is equal to 0 that means a is equal to zero so this will be useful next we have two b equal to one if two b is equal to one b is going to be one half so now going back to yp we want to plug in a and b into the expression since a is 0 this is going to disappear now we can plug in b into that because we have a number for b so y sub p will be one half x sine x so now that we have y sub p we can finish this problem so our general solution y is going to be the sum of y c and y p so y c we know that's a c one cosine x plus c 2 sine x y sub p is going to be plus one half x sine x so this is the solution to the differential equation so that's the final answer for this example now this is going to be the last problem so here we have y double prime minus 9y is equal to x e to the x plus sine 2x go ahead and try that problem now as always we are going to start with the complementary equation so we have r squared minus nine is equal to zero so that means r squared is equal to nine taking the square root of both sides we get r is plus or minus three so we have two real solutions thus we have case number one where the general solution is going to be c one e r one x plus c two e r two x so let's write this solution here so r one is positive three and r two is negative three so that's y yc we'll save this for later now notice that this problem that is on the right side contains a sum of two parts so to get the general solution to this differential equation it's going to be y which is equal to yc plus yp1 plus yp2 so yp1 will be associated with x e to the x y p 2 will be associated with sine 2x so let's focus on yp1 so we're going to have y double prime minus 9y we're going to set that equal to x e to the x now x is a linear expression and if you think of the straight line equation y equals mx plus b instead of m we're going to use a so for yp it's going to be ax plus b times e to the x this is for the linear part of that expression now what we need to do is find the first derivative and we need to use the product rule to do that the derivative of the first part ax plus b is simply a and we're going to leave the second part alone next we're going to keep the first part the same and then differentiate the second part the derivative of e to the x is simply e to the x now we need to find the second derivative the derivative of a e to the x is just a to the e to the x and then we have the derivative of this thing again which we did it here so we just got to rewrite this solution so it's going to be plus a e c x plus a x plus b e to the x so combining like terms that is these two we have 2 a e to the x plus ax plus b e to the x so now at this point we can plug in y and y double prime into that expression so it's going to be what we have here y double prime minus 9 times y and y is a x plus b times e to the x and that's going to equal what we have here x e to the x let's distribute and combine like terms so we have 2 a e to the x plus a ax e to the x if you distribute the e and then plus b e to the x distributing the negative 9 we're going to have negative 9 a x e to the x and then negative nine b e c x so we could combine these two that will be negative eight a x e eats the x and we can combine those two which will be negative a b e c x so we're going to have negative 8 a and i'm going to put that in parenthesis e to the x and then combining all the constants this one is 2a and these two combine that's negative 8b and they're attached to e to the x here this is going to be 1 times x e c x oh by the way there should be an x here as we can see this is negative 8 a x e to the x and then this has an e c x which we don't have on the right side so i'm going to write that as 0 times e to the x now we're going to set negative eight a equal to one so we can see that a is negative one over eight and then we're going to set this equal to zero so two a minus eight b is equal to zero substitute in a with negative one over eight and then moving this to the other side so this is going to equal positive eight b now negative one over a times two is negative one over four to get b by itself we need to multiply both sides by one over eight so b is going to be negative one over thirty two so now we could take a and b and plug it into this expression to get yp sub 1. so y p sub 1 that's going to be i'm going to factor out the negative sign from both these numbers so it's going to be negative and then 1 over 8 x plus 1 over 32 times e to the x so now that we have y p1 we just need to get yp2 and then we can get our final answer so we're going to set the left side of the equation equal to the second part of the right side of the equation that is sine 2x so we need to decide what y p sub 2 is going to be so it has to have something with sine and cosine so we're going to set it equal to d cosine 2x and then plus e sine 2x so now let's find the first derivative the derivative of cosine x is negative sine x the derivative of cosine 2x is negative sine 2x times the derivative of 2x which is 2. so we're going to get negative 2 d sine 2x the derivative of e sine 2x is going to be 2 e cosine 2x so now let's get the second derivative so this is going to be the derivative of sine 2x is cosine 2x times 2 so we're going to have negative 4d times cosine 2x and differentiating cosine 2x we're going to get negative sine 2x times 2. so 2e times 2 that's 4e but with a negative sign and then sine 2x so now we have everything that we need and so let's plug it into that expression so y double prime that's going to be negative 4d cosine 2x minus 4e sine 2x and then it's going to be minus 9y so y is what we have here and so that's d cosine 2x plus e sine 2x and then that's going to equal sine 2x so let's go ahead and combine like terms so we have negative 4d cosine negative 9d cosine so that's negative 13d cosine 2x combining these two that's going to be negative 13e sine 2x now we don't have a cosine on the right side so i'm going to write 0 times cosine 2x we do have a sine so i'm going to put plus 1 times sine 2x now let's get rid of some stuff so we don't need everything up to here right now let's set negative 13d equal to zero which means d is equal to zero and we can set negative thirteen e equal to one so e is negative 1 over 13. so now plug in d and e into that formula d is 0 so that's going to disappear so we get yp 2 is e or negative 1 over 13 times sine two x so now we have everything we need we have y c y p one y p two so the final answer is going to be yc which is c1 e raised to the 3x plus c2 e raised to the negative 3x plus yp1 which is negative 1 over 8 x plus 1 over 32 e to the x plus y p 2 which is negative 1 over 13 sine to the 2x so that is the solution to the differential equation that's it for this problem so that's it for this video thanks again for watching if you like it don't forget to subscribe to this channel ","[Music] foreign welcome back so this is the third lecture on the series of eigenvalues eigenvectors and how to solve systems of differential equations this is one of my absolute favorites because this is where it all comes together so I'm staying late just for this lecture in the last few we have talked about why we have you know these ordinary these systems of ordinary differential equations x dot equals ax X is a vector a is a matrix and these Dynamics are coupled but it's a lot easier to solve this system of equations if a was a diagonal matrix so we try to find a coordinate transformation some Matrix T some invertible Matrix T into some new coordinate system Z so that Z dot equals a diagonal matrix Z because this is way way easier to solve this system where D is diagonal and the Dynamics are decoupled then this system here where a is not diagonal and specifically we derived the eigenvalue eigenvector equation for the t's and the D's where this is possible specifically a times T equals T times D this is the eigenvalue problem Columns of T are eigenvectors of a the diagonal elements of D are eigenvalues of a so so the the coordinate transformation that diagonalizes a are specifically The Matrix of eigenvectors of a and the D the diagonal system that you get after doing that these diagonal entries of D are the eigenvalues of a good so I think I want to just show a couple of things I'm going to do a little bit of python Matlab demonstration here just to convince you that yes in fact d equals what did I have t inverse a t is true and also conversely that if I had D and T um that a would equal uh T times d times T inverse okay and it's really really really easy to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors in Matlab and python so I'm just going to show you that real quick and then what I'm going to do kind of the culmination of this set of lectures is I'm going to use I'm going to assume that we've gotten a we've decomposed a into its eigenvectors T and its eigenvalues D so you know however means you know python or Matlab we started with a and we solved for T and d and then I'm going to show you that with those matrices I can solve my original system of equations up here so this is like my favorite lecture in differential equations so far and so I'm just going to show you right now so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm literally just going to confirm in fact that you know it's easy to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors okay so I'm going to start in Matlab so I'm creating an a matrix 0 1 negative 2 negative 3 and all I'm going to do is get its eigenvectors T and its eigenvalues D using the IG command the built-in IG command so it's literally one line to get all of the eigenvectors and all of the eigenvalues so I'm just going to uh run that and so T our eigenvectors one okay so it normalizes them so that they have length one so if you take you know this entry squared plus this entry squared it'll have length one same with this but um essentially you can think of this as you know the one negative One Direction and this is the I guess it looks like the minus one two direction and what I'm going to confirm for you and then our eigenvalues are negative one and negative two so I'm going to confirm these two expressions here so if I take in of T times a times T that had better equal my diagonal matrix and yes in fact it does minus one zero zero minus two and I'll confirm the other one that if I take T times my diagonal matrix times the inv of T that should equal my original a matrix and in fact it equals 0 1 minus 2 minus 3. good quick sanity check it's real easy to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors one line of Matlab and these properties that we think should hold do in fact hold let's just do kind of similar things in in Python here again you can you know import numpy as NP I actually don't need these other ones this is just from another script so I'm going to create an array the same array 0 1 minus two minus 3 and it's just as easy to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors it's just you know from NP Lin alge it's again the IG command so just I give a and it spits out eigenvalues and eigenvectors in these these structures so I'll just run this run run edit printed out the eigenvalues if I want to uh what's happening if I want to print the E the IG Vex that should also work and again it is normalizing them to be unit um unit Norm so you can Define your eigenvector any Vector along an eigenvector direction is technically an eigenvector we usually pick the convention that our eigenvector has a unit length that uniquely determines it okay and these are the same as before and so clearly these are also going to hold good um that's all I wanted to show you in code so now what I'm going to do is we are going to use these um diagonal matrix D and these eigenvectors T to solve our differential equation okay um and so we know that it's quite easy to compute um it's easy to compute the solution of this this is just um Z of T equals e to the Matrix D time times whatever initial conditions I have I should probably write down my initial conditions I have you know X at time 0 are my initial conditions and those initial conditions are going to you know have a corresponding initial condition in Z this is literally Z naught is T inverse X naught that's pretty simple and I'm mentions x dot equal s Lambda X if I had um if I had x dot equals Lambda X for a scalar X and for a number Lambda and I had some initial condition then the solution would be X at time T equals e to the Lambda t times my initial condition e to the Lambda T times x naught and so here I'm guessing that I get something similar that X my Vector X at time T is probably going to be e to the Matrix a times time the vector of initial conditions okay now the question is how do I compute this Matrix exponential I haven't shown you how to do this and so that's kind of one of the things I'm going to show you in this lecture is how do you compute this Matrix exponential and how do you use T and D to make it really easy to compute this thing okay um so I shouldn't have erased all of my stuff so we know that a is equal to t d T inverse what do I want to to do here I want to tell you that this Matrix exponential sorry I'm skipping a step here this Matrix exponential e to the A T and I'm going to drop the under bars we know that a is a matrix I told you before that you can take the power series expansion for the exponential e to the X and you can substitute in this Matrix a t every time you see that variable X so the power series expansion of exponential says that this should be um I'll write e to the X so e to the x is just 1 plus X Plus x squared over 2 factorial plus X cubed over three factorial plus x to the fourth over four factorial plus Dot and so this this is going to be a matrix this isn't going to be a scalar so instead of one it's going to be the identity and instead of X it's going to be I'm going to substitute in a t every time I see an X so plus a t plus a squared t squared over 2 factorial plus a cubed T cubed over three factorial plus dot dot dot dot forever and ever and ever now Computing these Matrix Powers is going to get pretty tedious pretty fast like matrix multiplication is not cheap for big matrices so I don't want to be actually Computing all of these Matrix powers and so I'm going to use T and d and special properties of those to make it really really easy to compute these things that's that's kind of uh what I'm going to show you now Okay so um we already know that a equals T DT inverse that's fine we computed this using you know the IG command and python or Matlab and now I can write that a squared this is where it gets pretty fun a squared is just this thing times itself so it's t d T inverse times t d T inverse but notice that I have a t inverse times T so these actually cancel out and this equals T times my diagonal matrix squared times T inverse and this is actually not so bad to compute D Squared is easy I just Square all of the diagonal entries right like a diagonal matrix times itself a diagonal matrix squared is just the square of the diagonal entries okay it's another diagonal matrix where the entries are squared so this is actually easier to compute similarly we can compute A3 a cubed that is uh t d t inverse times t d t inverse times T I hope you're seeing the pattern here T inverse again all of these in the middle cancel and I'm left with t D to the third power T inverse again this is really easy to compute D cubed that's just a diagonal matrix with all of the entries of D cubed so that's nice and I can do this add nauseum if I wanted um dot dot dot a to the power n the nth power of a is just going to be the same exact thing it's going to be t D to the power n times T inverse and so basically every single term in here whenever I see an A or an a squared or an A cubed or so on and so forth I can plug in these expressions in terms of its eigen decomposition in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues sometimes I call that it's eigen decomposition this is the eigen decomposition of a and I'm going to use one more fact which is that this identity I can be written as t times T inverse okay that's all we need to write this down so what I'm going to write is that this expression here equals maybe I'll use pink since most of these here are pink so this equals uh T times T inverse Plus T times D times T inverse little time plus T times D squared times T inverse little times squared over 2 factorial Plus T times D cubed T inverse little time cubed over 3 factorial plus dot dot dot forever and ever and ever and now what I can do is I can say that every single term in this has a big T on the left and a big T inverse on the right this scalar thing I can move that anywhere because it's just a scalar so the Matrix part of this has a big T on the left and a t inverse on the right for every single term in this expansion and so that equals Big T times identity plus dot a bunch of stuff times T inverse and this is the stuff inside is the identity plus a diagonal matrix t plus a diagonal matrix squared t squared over 2 factorial plus a diagonal matrix cubed T cubed over three factorial Plus and now you'll see so like if that was too fast just pause and convince yourself that this equals this I literally just popped this big T on the left from all of these and this big T inverse on the right from all of these and then I collected all the stuff in the middle identity Big D times T Big D Squared t squared over two factorial D cubed T cubed over three factorial and now actually really really easy all of the stuff in the middle is the power series expansion the the representation of e to the diagonal matrix t but we know that this is actually really easy to compute all of these matrices all of these powers of D are just still diagonal matrices and so to get this e to the power Matrix D times t this is literally just a diagonal matrix you know e to the Lambda 1 t e to the Lambda 2T dot dot dot dot with zeros everywhere else I can just write this Matrix exponential down for this diagonal matrix I don't even have to compute this this is just I can write this down okay it's a diagonal matrix with e to the Lambda T's and so now I hope you're seeing that instead of computing this infinite set of powers of a which is going to be heinous to do now all I have to do is compute the eigen decomposition I get T and D I compute e to the DT and I multiply it on the left with Big T and on the right with Big T inverse and that is my solution my solution X at time T I'm going to write this down maybe I'll write it down in green X at time t is equal to Big T e to the diagonal matrix times time times Big T inverse that's e to the a t all of this is e to the a t times X naught okay this is the solution this is the solution to x dot equals a x with this initial condition X naught original differential equation that was really hard to solve maybe I could have you know guessed that this is the form of the solution but still how do I compute this Matrix exponential this is going to be a nightmare to do for a generic a matrix so instead what we do is we think well it would be a lot easier if this was diagonal so let's find a coordinate transformation into a coordinate system Z where my Dynamics are diagonal and decoupled so I know how to solve that easily it's easy to compute e to the diagonal matrix T I do that by finding my eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this a matrix so my eigenvectors T my eigenvalue is D and then I also find that those eigenvalues and eigenvectors make it much much easier for me to compute this Matrix exponential I can kind of write every time I see an a matrix I can write it in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors I can split terms and collect terms and get this very simple expression that that Matrix exponential e to the Matrix a times time is a matrix I know times a really easy diagonal exponential Matrix times another Matrix I know I can compute all three of these terms very very easily whereas I could not compute all of these infinitely many terms easily so this is much much nicer okay one last thing I want to show you this is kind of uh for me one of the highlights of this lecture is now we're going to interpret this expression this solution so this is a big deal this is the solution we're going to interpret this step by step okay so this T inverse times x naught T inverse times x naught is literally Z naught so this term here is Z naught so essentially what we're doing is we are taking our initial conditions in the x coordinate system in my original coordinate system that I you know I wrote down my Dynamics in my original x coordinate system for some reason I must have had a good reason so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my initial conditions I'm going to map them through T inverse into a set of initial conditions in my nice Z coordinate system so this is you know I'm writing I'm writing my initial conditions uh in Z coordinates in Z coordinates then what I'm doing is I'm multiplying by e to the Matrix d t so this whole thing e to the Matrix the diagonal matrix D times time times Z naught this is literally Z at some future time T this is z of t so what I've done is I've taken my initial condition I've mapped it into Z coordinates where it's easy to to write down the solution it's easy to write down Z of T in these Z coordinates it's just you know my initial condition times this diagonal matrix that's Z of t so this is my uh solution in Z coordinates which is easy and then finally what I do is now I have the solution in Z coordinates but again I wanted it in x coordinates in the first place I care I started in x coordinates and so to get back to x coordinates I just multiply by a big T that's multiplied by Big T and now I'm back in X so now we're back to the solution in x coordinates and I think this is just really really cool like this for me is one of my favorite pictures in uh in differential equations is um this solution here and this real physical interpretation these matrices T and D are not magic okay this is not uh eigenvalues and eigenvectors don't come out of nowhere they are very very simple and intuitive matrices that are useful for solving systems of differential equations the T inverse Matrix Maps me from x coordinates into Z coordinates my initial condition X naught into Z naught in those Z coordinates my Dynamics are diagonal this diagonal matrix are my eigenvalues of my a matrix and so it's easy to write e to the DT to solve to move Z naught forward in time to Z at some future time and then to go back to my original coordinates I just multiply by T again so very very intuitive very very kind of simple in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues how you solve x of t Okay um good that was it that was a big lecture I'm ready to go home now in the next lectures we're going to look at specific a matrices that have certain structure that have really interesting eigenvalues and eigenvectors so for example when these eigenvectors are purely real and negative this will be a stable system when they're purely real and positive it'll be an unstable system when they are imaginary I'll have a rotating system you know kind of oscillating system cosines and Sines and I'm going to build up all of your intuition for these systems of differential equations for the whole menagerie of of ordinary differential equations you can have in terms of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors this is the new language we're going to use to understand these systems of equations okay that's all coming up soon thank you [Music] ","welcome estimate ish ins I have another video for you in my series on the Laplace transform if you don't know what the last transform is that's totally fine down in the description I have an entire playlist introducing the Laplace transform give this video a like so that the YouTube gal the room starts promoting more math videos which we should do with these challenging times and let's get into the video in this video we're going to see how we can use the last transform to solve an initial value problem like this one I have y double prime minus y minus 2 y equal to 0 some OD e together with two initial conditions y 0 is 1 and y prime of 0 is equal to 0 the big idea of Laplace transforms is that we are going to apply the Laplace transform and turn this differential equation into an algebraic equation the algebraic equation we're going to be able to solve and then we can invert the process by taking the inverse Laplace transform and getting back to a solution to our original initial value problem let's see how to do that so the method is gonna be first to take the Laplace transform of those sides so let me do that I'm going to first take the Laplace transform of Y double prime I'm going to subtract off the Laplace transform of the Y prime and I'm going to subtract off twice the Laplace transform of just Y this is what it means to be linear that I could say the Laplace transform of some with your combination is the lousier combination of the Laplace transforms on the right side this is nothing but the Laplace transform of 0 which is indeed just going to be 0 to make our lives a little bit easier I'm going to define the new notation that Y of s is just going to be a standing for the Laplace transform of the function y of T that I began with ok so now I need to figure out what is the plasterer transform of the first derivative the second derivative and so forth but this is something we computed actually in a previous video so let's do the first one let's do the Laplace transform of Y double prime here the expression we had seen was that it was an S squared times y of s and then it was going to subtract off and s times y of 0 and then subtract off a y prime of zero that is it becomes s squared times this new variable Y and then it had just two constants y 0 and y prime 0 just constants we're going to solve for those with the initial condition all right next up I need to subtract off the Laplace transform of the derivative and the first road is a little bit simpler it was s times y of s and then I suggest subtract off by Y of 0 finally I subtract off by 2 times just the Laplace transform of Y which we defined to be just capital y of s and then the right-hand side is once again 0 now I'm gonna take those initial conditions the why is there only one in the Y prime is 0 equal to 0 and just plug them in and let's just see what happens there this is gonna give me well s squared times y of s y 0 was 1 so I'm gonna have a subtraction of an S then I subtract off just nothing so minus is 0 then I subtract off s times y ms I then have another subtract off Y if not but it's got two minus signs now and as a result it's going to give me a plus one and then a minus two times y of s and all of this is equal to 0 now this equation that I have here is an equation in terms of the variables Y and s and I want to solve it so that y can be written as some function of s the way I do this is I'm gonna try to make Y that's be on the left-hand side so what's on the right-hand side well everything else looks like got a minus s that's gonna move over become a plus s and then I'm plus 1 that's gonna move over become a minus 1 and then I'm going to divide out by the coefficients of Y of s which looks like an S squared a minus s and a minus 2 and bro and so that is my answer that is algebraically solving for y the function of s now I'm not done yet I took this differential equation and I converted it via the Laplace transform put an algebraic equation and I sold that algebraic equation but I don't have a solution to the original differential equation so I have to undo the process on how I have to apply the inverse transform so the question is what is the inverse Laplace transform of this thing of this s minus 1 over s squared minus s minus 2 so that's what we're going to turn to next and the way we do this in general is to try to recognize these functions that we want to take the inverse Laplace transform of couldn't recognize them in terms of things that we already know in terms of expressions that we already know they're inverse Laplace transform and the major algebraic trick I'm going to use to do that is partial fractions so let me recall how that works all right so my first trick is just going to be to factor and I you see that in the denominator I can write this as s minus 2 times s plus 1 then the magic of partial fractions is that we aim to write this complicated rational expression as a single variable a over the first linear factor which is s minus 2 and then a second B over the second linear factor which is s plus 1 the way partial fractions worked was let's multiply both sides by the denominator here that's s minus 2 times s plus 1 and that's going to give me that on the left-hand side when I multiply it by the denominator you get X minus 1 and on the right-hand side a times s plus 1 and B times s minus 2 there's several ways to proceed here but the way I'm going to look at it is I'm going to do the coefficients of the one on the left-hand side that's just going to be a minus 1 and on the right hand side their coefficient of 1 looks like an A and then a minus 2 B likewise I'm going to compute the coefficients of a switch on the right hand side looks like there's one ass on the right hand side there's an A times an S and they be times an S so so what I've done here by looking the coefficients of 1 and the coefficient of s is to take this single equation and actually think of it as two separate equations one in essence one in terms of one well we can solve these easily enough if I look at the bottom expression that's going to give you that a is 1 minus B if I take that and plug it into the top expression then this is going to give me that minus one is equal to one minus B minus 2b so I have a minus two on the left for the 1 over a minus 3 and so my B is two thirds so B is two thirds and if the a is one minus two thirds then that's going to imply that the a is equal to one-third so I figured out what my a is and I figured out what my yes all right so having done that partial fraction stuff I'm gonna come down here and take this expression of Y of s and I am now going to write it as one-third over s minus two and two thirds over s plus one this is my rewriting of this expression okay so let's move that up as well and then we can study it what my final goal was is to compute the inverse Laplace transform of this but now I finally rid it in a way that I can understand and the reason is because I know a Laplace transform that looks like this in particular I will recall for you the fact that the Laplace transform of something of the form e to the a T this was nothing but 1 over s minus a and indeed this y of s just looks like 1 over s minus a for two different values of a 1 B minus 2 would 1 being plus 1 so my final real step is to take the inverse Laplace transform of this Y of s and indeed well what was the y of s so copy the inverse transform again but what was big why that's anyways well it was the Laplace transform of the original Y of T so what I have is the inverse Laplace transform other Laplace transform these cancel and what I'm just going to be left with is the Y of T and then what actually is this it is the inverse Laplace transform of the right-hand side which is one-third times something looks like an exponential in 2/3 times some of those an exponential by linearity what I get is the 1/3 first exponential since it's s minus 2 is e to the 2t and then plus 2/3 and the second exponential because it's s plus 1 kind of look like things of the form s minus a is therefore e to the minus T so what I finally have is a solution to the original initial value problem the differential equation together with the initial conditions I'll leave it to you to check that if you take the Drona's and plug it into indeed this does work so this examples hopefully Illustrated to you why this method of Laplace transforms is so effective by converting our original differential equation into an algebraic one that that also included the initial condition data we're able to solve that and invert back and now we have a solution to our original differential equation "],"quizzes":[{"quiz":[{"type":"multiple-choice","question":"When adding or subtracting fractions, what is
